<h1>A PLEA FOR MONOGAMY</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TRUE CONCEPTION OF MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Common sense indicates, happiness and health demand, science
proclaims and society is beginning to insist that men and women
understand and apply the palpable truth of the sex relations in
their married life.—<span class="smcap">Dr. W. F. Robie.</span></p>

</div>

<h3 id="section1">§ 1</h3>

<p>We are living in an age when the contrast between
intellectual complexity and emotional simplicity
is becoming so great that the emotional
reactions and, because of them, the creative and
destructive acts of men are more and more unpredictable
and variegated. Intellectual attainment
has reached an extraordinary height. Emotions
have not been trained or developed, if indeed they
are capable of development. They may not be,
though it will be assumed in a later chapter that
they are susceptible of the kind of training that is
produced by reassociation. Emotions are the organic
sensations perceived by the ego as the result
of reactions, caused by impressions from the external
world, reactions taking place within the tissues
of the body, and associated with external impressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Emotions are no more complex than
they were thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>When we say that the emotions of one man are
finer than those of another man we may mean either
that he has repressed his sexual emotions, which we
have not been taught to call fine, or that his emotions
of surprise, awe, love, hate, jealousy and
others are aroused by, that is, associated with, more
complicated external impressions than they are in
another man. Or we may call fine emotions the constructive
emotions with which pleasure is associated.</p>

<p>The emotions as physical reactions have not
changed in ages of evolution. We have the same
bodies as sounding boards on which the external
impressions reverberate, the same bodies practically
that men had five thousand years ago. But the
number and variety of external experiences has multiplied
in geometrical ratio. The result is that,
while intellectually we are men of 1923, emotionally
we may be cave men or apes. With the products
of modern civilization, the material advances and
complications, the means of intercommunication, of
graphic representation and of the transformation
of natural resources we are, as Robinson says in
<cite>The Mind in the Making</cite>, merely <em>monkeying</em>. In
spite of numerous sporadic beginnings in the line
of social use of the results of modern scientific
advancement we are as a race making almost no
progress in the direction of fine living.</p>

<h3 id="section2">§ 2</h3>

<p>This is no more clearly evident in any other
sphere of life than in marriage. With all the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
progress made by humanity up to the first
quarter of the twentieth century marriage is still
looked upon by many men merely as an opportunity
for either legitimized procreation or unlimited
sensual self-gratification. A man puts as much
intellect into his vocation as he is capable of. Into
his marriage he puts not intellect, but the emotions
of the ancestral ape. Even in his sublimated war
of business he knows that a consideration of the
other fellow is in the end a winning card, and the
word “service” has come into prominence as advertising
material. But in his marriage he uses the
same crassly selfish methods he has used for thousands,
perhaps millions of years.</p>

<p>The sheer blind, isolating selfishness of the average
husband and the misery it causes him are the
reason for my writing this book. If a man used
one-tenth the intellect in his marital relations that
he does in his corporation finance and in his inventions
and scientific research, the latter would not be
half as necessary as they seem to be, and he would
himself be infinitely happier.</p>

<h3 id="section3">§ 3</h3>

<p>Unless we are progressing toward a woman-made
social order it is imperative that men carry on to
a logical conclusion what they have begun.</p>

<p>“Charity begins at home” is one of the many
maxims that were originated with a far different
connotation from that which they have since
acquired. Charity (Latin <i lang="la">Caritas</i>) originally
meant “dearness” or “fondness” and once had an
erotic flavour that it has since lost. The only place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for sexual love is in marriage and its having escaped
from this, like a captured thing, reflects not so
much on itself as on the unnaturalness of its captivity.
True erotism has practically fled from most
marriages, leaving only an empty shell. Men should
reflect that nothing is more necessary for the upbuilding
of a real civilization than the personal lives of
the individuals themselves. Penetratingly thoughtful
men realize that the present state of civilization
is diseased throughout, and that it “is not in our
stars but in ourselves,” that we are to rely for
advance.</p>

<h3 id="section4">§ 4</h3>

<p>In this book an attempt is made to show how men
can so control their marital situation as to make
more and more unnecessary the tightness of the
bond that operates to make many marriages so like
an imprisonment for both husbands and wives. Also
the suggestion is made that a certain type of action
on the husband’s part will work in the direction of
making both prostitution and divorce less and less
necessary.</p>

<p>This type of behaviour, comparatively rare at the
present time, is based on a pattern that will at once
appeal to the sense of justice innate in every man.
Although it implies a relaxation of much present
constraint and artificiality in the married relation,
it is in no sense antagonistic to true monogamous
union but rather constitutes a much more advanced
and progressive attitude toward the most vital question
of the day.</p>

<p>The marriage of the near future, it is hoped, will
be inspired by our latest scientific knowledge concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the psychology of sex, including the ever
present unconscious factor, which is the most potent
factor in the marital situation and which has been
necessarily ignored for the simple reason that, previous
to a few years ago, everyone was ignorant of
the unconscious mechanisms and their relation to
each other, in making for mistakes and unhappiness
in marital behaviour.</p>

<p>If every man would exercise the control over himself
(the opposite of asceticism in the ordinarily
accepted sense), the control which alone will secure
that emotional ascendancy over his wife, necessary
for happy marriage and unconsciously longed for
by the wife, more than any other thing in marital
life, he will reduce to the lowest possible frequency
both divorce, which is the issue of so many marriages,
and prostitution, which has for so many
centuries been regarded as the bulwark of marriage
and the protection of the wife.</p>

<p>As Grete Meisel-Hess says in her <cite>Sexual Crisis</cite>,
“The happy marriage of the securely placed wife is
founded upon the degradation and debasement of
another woman, the prostitute”; and Havelock Ellis
in the sixth volume of his <cite>Psychology of Sex</cite> (page
296) says that “the value of marriage as a moral
agent is evidenced by the fact that all the better-class
prostitutes in London are almost entirely supported
by married men,” while “in Germany, as stated in
the interesting series of reminiscences by a former
prostitute, the majority of the men who visit prostitutes
are married.” He then gives several reasons
why this is the case.</p>

<p>If every wife should give serious thought to exactly
how much degradation the prostitute has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
considered to save her from, she would realize that
what the prostitute guards her from could be transmuted
by the proper attitude on the husband’s part
from a crassly physical into a highly spiritual thing.
And she would move heaven and earth to induce her
husband to study the fine art of love in so thorough
a manner that there could be no doubt of the happy
issue of their mutual love life.</p>

<p>Critics of marriage as it exists today have amply
demonstrated that it shields more immorality, in
some cases, than even prostitution itself; and it is a
fact that this immorality comes from a lack of
spiritual rapport between husband and wife, that
can be effected primarily, if not solely, by the
husband.</p>

<h3 id="section5">§ 5</h3>

<p>While this book assumes that the marital relation
is one in which an emotional control is necessary to
be exercised by the husband over the wife, it does
not assume for a moment but rather denies that the
husband should exert any control whatever over the
activities of the wife, especially in spheres other than
the strictly conjugal.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a husband domineers in small
every-day matters only when, and because, he feels
unconsciously that he is failing, or is beginning to
fail, to dominate in the great and important sphere
of woman’s emotional life.</p>

<p>For the health and happiness of them both, this
sphere should be the love emotions; at any rate,
only the constructive or anabolic emotions. A husband
who rightly dominates need not and will not
trouble to domineer. If the wife is as profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
moved erotically by marriage as she should be this
deep emotion will impel her to develop her personality
to the utmost for the advantage of her husband
and, <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>, of herself.</p>

<p>It should always be borne in mind by both husband
and wife that the love impulse is uniformly
to take precedence over the ego (social) impulse, a
precedence that, however, in our present competitive
society it is very difficult to give. But it is worth
every thought that can be devoted to it; to refine
the pattern, to ennoble the picture, of marital life.</p>

<h3 id="section6">§ 6</h3>

<p>A common misapprehension that psychoanalysis
leads to promiscuity in sexual relations needs emphatic
correction. The reasoning wrested out of
psychoanalytical findings runs somewhat as follows:
Most modern ills and notably neurotic disturbances,
mild and severe, are the result of the repression
brought to bear on the sex instinct by modern civilized
life. Therefore, in order to avoid or cure these
multitudinous ills, the individual whose natural instincts
have been repressed, must dig them up, with
great toil and at great expense of time and money,
and give them free play in spite of the prohibitions
of society. Indeed, in this country, psychoanalysts,
of the first rank in other respects, have been said
to recommend both men and women patients to
make what arrangements they could to indulge in
sexual intercourse, even if unmarried.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Now fully admitting that the mental and physical
troubles of these patients, and all others who suffer
from ills of psychic origin, arise from the repression
of the sexual instinct, it still shows a far too great
tendency on the part of their advisers to temporize
and compromise with facts, if they give this advice.
For, while a conflict between two forces, one or both
of which were in the unconscious, is more satisfactorily
and successfully carried on if the two forces
are brought out into the open light of consciousness,
the conflict still remains, and is only shifted to another
field where it may go on as before, and with
unabated fierceness.</p>

<p>The conflict between the individual and society is
just as great whether a man takes it out in himself
through a neurosis or gives up the neurosis and takes
a prostitute or a regular mistress, neither of which
has the sanction of society. In the case of many
neurotics the cure is worse than the disease simply
because the social pressure becomes clearer to the
individual if he actually does, even in secret, the
things he had before only unconsciously wished.
For him the conflict not only is not resolved but is
worse, for if like the majority of neurotics he is
of a more sensitive type than the average person
the contrast between his actions and the implicit
demands of his environment will be all the greater.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
He will be doing in reality the very thing he unconsciously
desired but feared to do.</p>

<p>And yet not the same thing after all. For unless
the mistress is of that rare and extraordinary type
of Mlle. Drouet who supplied for Victor Hugo
what he would have much preferred to get from his
wife, had she been spiritually able to give it, there
will be, for the unfortunately advised neurotic,
another conflict not on an ethical but on an intellectual
and spiritual plane.</p>

<p>The advice for such people can only be to get
married; or, if that is beyond the bounds of possibility,
which is seldom the case, the suggestion to
adopt a moderate autoerotism has been made by
some physicians in good standing as an acceptable
substitute at least for the neurotic of either sex. It
frees them, at any rate, from the feeling that they
are injuring anyone else, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>An emphatic reiteration is here appropriate concerning
the harmlessness of the physical forms of
autoerotism as practised, at some times in their lives,
by almost nine-tenths of humanity of both sexes,
especially civilized humanity, where a taboo is
placed on other normal heterosexual practices. The
autoerotism mentioned (in <a href="#section21">sections 21-25</a> on mutuality)
is purely a psychical intellectual or mental
autoerotism entirely apart from the physical. Its
results are, in the long run, far worse. (See note,
<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.)</p>

<p>Grete Meisel-Hess, in <cite>The Sexual Crisis</cite>, speaking
of the men who are sexual compulsion neurotics and
whom she describes as male counterparts of the
<i lang="fr">demi-vierges</i>, says (page 155): “They are unable
to surmount the ultimate obstacle between I and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Thou. They are unable to complete their work,
incompetent to possess a woman utterly. The amatory
intimacies are never fully consummated. They
get through the preliminaries of love and the first
preludes; but that which comes afterward, the most
beautiful and also the most difficult part, remains
unenjoyed, unmastered, unconsummated. I am not
referring here to what is ordinarily termed impotence.
This sentimental impotence has nothing to
do with mere physical weakness, but is far more
disastrous, since it forever bars those affected with
it from an entry into the deepest experiences of love.
It is only the strong in soul who are capable of love
in its completeness.”</p>

<p>The physical autoerotic acts, far from having
the results of producing physical and mental
weakness (as has been unscientifically stated and
slavishly repeated for two centuries), are nature’s
way of developing the reproductive apparatus
for strictly human use. The injuries supposed
to result are now scientifically proven to be the
result caused by the fear of harm, and the shame
inspired in young people by stupidly ignorant elders.</p>

<p>The autoerotic mental attitude described in this
section is a peculiarity of men who through lack of
enlightenment have not yet outgrown a tendency to
remain, in their psychic reactions, infantile or puerile.
But there is no proof that the inevitably autoerotic
attitude of the young need persist for a
moment after they have grasped the idea of the
difference between autoerotism and a real object
love that contains the growing element of perfect
mutuality. And yet many men unnecessarily get
the idea fixed in their minds that autoerotic practices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
have weakened them physically or have produced
a mental habit of mind that cannot be broken.
From one point of view it is the easiest thing in the
world to present the proofs of the utter harmlessness
of the autoerotic practices and the utter groundlessness
of the fears which make almost every man, that
is human, lack the confidence which will give him
the necessary control over his own, and incidentally
over his wife’s, erotism. (See note, <a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="section7">§ 7</h3>

<p>The recommendation to the neurotic patient to
take up clandestine sex relationship is based on the
same misinterpretation of psychoanalytic theory
that is seen in the explanation given by shallow,
self-styled psychoanalysts of Freud’s term “polymorphous
perverse” as applied to the sexuality of
children. <em>Polymorphous</em> means “of many shapes or
patterns,” and implies that a child gets as much
pleasure and satisfaction from stimulation of any
one of its “erogenous zones” as it does from any
other including the genital. This is quite easily
comprehensible from the point of view that the
child’s sexuality, like the unassembled parts of an
automobile, is synthetized at puberty under the
“primacy of the genital zones” whereupon all the
pleasures of stimulation of all the other zones serve
only as preliminaries to that of the genital.</p>

<p>And the word <em>perverse</em> in its etymological significance
means only “turned in all directions,” i.e., as
much toward one zone as to another. But the
word perverse in its ordinary sense has the connotation
of moral turpitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be as senseless to call a child’s interest
in its skin, and pleasure in sucking its thumb or a
piece of candy, perverse in this latter sense as it
would be to call a ring gear of a differential <em>wicked</em>
just because it was lying on the floor of a garage,
and the mechanic had not yet put it in place.</p>

<p>Thus has Freud been misinterpreted and the good
of all his fearless investigation into sexual life annulled
by the shortsighted and ignorant misreading
of his work on the part of so many of those who
would call themselves his followers.</p>

<h3 id="section8">§ 8</h3>

<p>Only marriage and only a pure and complete
monogamy without anesthesia<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on the part of either
mate will satisfy both conscious and unconscious
cravings of the neurotic. It is a great advantage to
have these unconscious cravings introduced into consciousness
if for the only reason of giving a greater
self-knowledge and therefore a greater self-confidence.</p>

<p>Not only all conscious and unconscious love cravings
can, but all should be satisfied in every marriage
from the beginning of it all through to the end of it.
By the majority of healthy people they should be
given conscious expression by both mates much more
frequently than they actually are.</p>

<h3 id="section9">§ 9</h3>

<p>So many unhappily married people ask, “What,
Doctor, <em>is</em> a normal sex life?” It is generally considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by all authorities that individuals vary to
such an extent that it is impossible to lay down any
rule except that in the normal sex life the conscious
outward expression should never take place except
when it is a mutual and reciprocal expression, and
that, on these conditions, no limits that could be
called normal really exist.</p>

<p>But the attitude of this book is that the mutuality
is largely if not entirely the result of the husband’s
love-making. In the ideal marriage he is and always
should be the leading factor in the exclusively erotic
sphere.</p>

<h3 id="section10">§ 10</h3>

<p>Every use of the term erotic episode or love episode
or love drama, is to be understood as emphatically
affirming the indispensability of an equal
emphasis on both the so-called physical and the so-called
mental or spiritual factor of the love life,
neither one nor the other omitted, neither one nor
the other unduly overweighted.</p>

<p>We are minds or souls inhabiting or, better, organically
connected with bodies. Everyone knows
the body cannot be neglected any more than the
mind. But the most mental of the bodily reactions
and the most bodily of the mental reactions are the
emotions; and as far as present-day physiological
researches have been able to discover, both are most
closely interrelated by the interlocking system of
ductless glands, among which the interstitial or
sexual glands are the grand president of all the
boards of directors.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition first, in classical Greek and Roman
times, unduly overweighted the physical end and, in
modern times, has attempted unduly to overweight
the spiritual end of the balance, but neither of these
processes has restored a balance which is fundamental
to the highest type of Christianity—the balance
between the erotic<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the egoistic-social
trends.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This balance it is the object of this book
to suggest, with the hope that such an approach to
equilibrium of two tendencies that are now badly
out of balance will help to show the futility of much
activity that is now called civilized, but which is not
most adapted to producing the greatest happiness of
the individual, and through that, the greatest prosperity
of such people as are destined by happiness
and prosperity to survive the crumbling of the present
state of society.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Surprise of the Imperfectly Married</span></p>

<p><i>What? Every pair in every marriage attain absolute
bliss in every love episode? Do you mean to

<p>Of course, why not? Should one expect every

to act lower than the animals—to have abolished

<h3 id="section11">§ 11</h3>

<p>This book is written largely in the hope that the
thousands of unhappy married women, and the unmarried
too, as fate sometimes suddenly and unexpectedly
finds them a partner, will, in reading it,
realize what is making them so restless and discontented.</p>

<p>In the past few years all interested observers of
social phenomena have been appalled at the lightness
with which a great majority of the upper middle
classes regard matrimony.</p>

<p>Intelligent women, readers of good books, and
themselves often friends of authors, artists,
musicians, and other creative personalities are all
absorbed in the most vital topics of the day, chief
of which is the discussion of the normal adjustment
of the sex relation. Indeed, it has been charged
that both women and men in this stratum of society
talk sex <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>. This is likely to continue until
the much desired adjustment is better made than it
is at present.</p>

<p>The cause of this concentration upon sex problems
can be only the fact that sex is a problem. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
our sexual standards were fixed in a universally serviceable
pattern such that changing external conditions
did not almost hourly tend to make it
antiquated and useless, the attention of so large a
proportion of civilized humanity need not be given
to it in the present-day excited manner.</p>

<p>It is, of course, a question whether sexual problems
can ever be permanently solved; but those in
the focus of public attention today are so insistent
that it is impossible to ignore them. Various solutions
are being attempted more or less secretly
where public opinion’s ban on sex discussion is
stronger; less secretly elsewhere.</p>

<p>But a pattern of sexual behaviour, a true love pattern,
even if it could not be final should have at
least enough elasticity to make the changes in it a
gradual transition. No sensational innovations
can ever hope to be adopted overnight with the
approval of society at large. In fact, conventions
in other spheres than those of love are made, and
have been made gradually for centuries. But it is a
curious fact that the conventionalities which concern
the expression of the erotic impulse are those not
of yesterday but of many hundreds of years ago.
This is but a manifestation of the extreme complication
of the external circumstances of modern life in
contrast with the wonderful simplicity and directness
of the emotions themselves which reverberate
in response to the external complexities.</p>

<p>It will appear, as this discussion proceeds, that
the sexual problems of today are conditioned by
the inhibitions placed by modern economic conditions
upon the natural and instinctive expression of the
erotic impulse. In brief, both men and women talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sex and particularly women, in a certain extensive
class of society, for the real though disguised purpose
of exciting themselves sexually.</p>

<p>There is every satisfactory proof that this would
not occur if their sexual lives were normal. It is
therefore the repressed sexual activity that breaks
out, not in sexual acts specifically, but in the vicarious
sex activity of problem novels, problem plays,
risqué stories, and the talk in mixed company which
has been objected to as persistent sex talk.</p>

<p>Men and women with a perfectly normal love life
feel no need whatever to talk about it. But the
inference from that—namely, that those who resolutely
refrain from mention of all such topics are
themselves quite normal in their own love life—is
illogical in the extreme. Many are constrained by
an inner fear of self-revelation, lest they show themselves
as abnormal. Thus it may occur that some
will not refuse to discuss this most vital of all topics,
for fear they may be considered themselves
abnormal.</p>

<p>But it is safe to say that the greater number of
those who talk much about love are those whose love
is either undeveloped or in some way awry, and that
unconsciously they are attempting to straighten
themselves out, in their own eyes or in the eyes of
their friends.</p>

<h3 id="section12">§ 12</h3>

<p>The most exciting conversation on love is, of
course, that between two persons of opposite sex.
And in many social circles there has of late sprung
up a new term. A married woman will have some
particular male friend not her husband, whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
laughingly refers to as her “playmate.” With this
“mate” she plays at love and love-making under the
guise of serious discussion. In some coteries, the
married woman’s playmate may be some other
woman’s husband, but the favourites for playmates
are unmarried men.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>These “little beaux” or “playmates” are an indication
of the essential childishness of the marriage
relation where they play a part, and the position
of the husband whose wife needs such amusement
is an exceedingly unenviable one, no matter how
purely Platonic the relation may be between his wife
and her playmate.</p>

<h3 id="section13">§ 13</h3>

<p>It will be consistently maintained in this book
that the need of such Platonic friendships on the
part of these numerous wives is a reflection on the
lack of skill with which the husband handles the
erotic situation. He may not be, often, indeed, is
not, in the least to blame for his lack of skill, or for
the discontent of his wife that causes her to give
expression to the play side of love, or, even a part
of it, in this taking of a playmate. It is a situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which practically calls the husband a workmate, or
dutymate—a situation that is fundamentally deplorable
and constitutes in fact the first step in the
direction of divorce.</p>

<p>The playmates provide a large amount of innocent
amusement, which the husbands do not or cannot
find time possibly to furnish themselves. With
the playmates the wives go to lunches, dances,
theatres, concerts, and talk poetry, art, music—and
love.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to the fact that these wives
are not properly mated. It is not their fault. It is
their husbands’, yet, because of the husbands’ ignorance
of the love needs of women, the husbands are
not to blame, at any rate until they have taken to
heart the message which this book attempts to
convey.</p>

<p>Possibly the wives themselves, after thinking the
matter over in the light of what they may read in
this book, might talk to their husbands about love
now as perhaps once they did, and get them to realize
what they are failing to do.</p>

<p>Seeking intellectual stimulation from a playmate
whose tenure of office is permanent or nearly so is,
as psychoanalysis has amply demonstrated, a substitute
or vicariate for sex. The women are, but of
course unconsciously, wishing for more extended and
more intimate love episodes with their playmates.</p>

<p>In short, restlessness of wives is an expression
of the exclusively economic trend of present-day
civilization which makes a machine or an office
organization or a financial manipulation a substitute,
in the mind of the husband, for love. Such
a man is most likely to take his business home with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
him, where indeed business has no place—even, indeed,
take it to bed with him.</p>

<h3 id="section14">§ 14</h3>

<p>The writer is aware of the unprecedented character
of much that has just been said, but feels that
he knows whereof he speaks, also of the revolutionary
nature of the theses of the rest of this
chapter in which the subsequent matter of the book
is given in outline.</p>

<p>First, the statement that what is popularly known
as romantic love has little if any significance in true
marriage. For it will be maintained consistently
that given a not too impossible combination of man
and woman, as for example those of too widely
divergent social level, any man can woo and win any
woman and make her and himself supremely happy,
entirely apart from the neurotic sentimentality of
romanticism.</p>

<p>The theory that there is just one woman in the
world who can make a given man a perfect wife,
and vice versa, is scientifically absurd, for there is
only an infinitesimal chance that these two should
ever meet. Many useless tears have been shed by
men and women alike over these “ships that pass in
the night,” and thus frustrate what might have
been supernal happiness.</p>

<p>Concerning the marital relation, a common sense
view raised to scientific proportions, shows incontrovertibly
that married happiness is a creation of
the married people themselves and chiefly of the
husband. More in every way depends on him than
on the woman. As pointed out by Meisel-Hess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
“sexual crisis” of the present day is due to the failure
of the individual man to know how to play, and
to play acceptably, his part in married life.</p>

<p>Indeed, we may go so far as to say with absolute
confidence that if a Pacific liner should lose its way
and ground on a desert island, the thousand or so
men and women passengers, supposing they were all
young and unmarried, could put their names on slips
of paper in a box, and, knowing that they were
doomed to remain on the island for the rest of their
lives, draw lots for partners and become infinitely
more happily married lovers than the average
married couple in civilization and quite as happy
as if they had followed conscious preference.</p>

<p>But the stipulation is made that the five hundred
men at least must be adepts in the erotic technique.</p>

<p>That is to say that the real happiness of a marriage
depends solely on the behaviour of the husband,
consciously planned intelligent knowledge of
what a real marriage implies.</p>

<h3 id="section15">§ 15</h3>

<p>It will be shown in the subsequent chapters that
the aim of marriage is not, as the reiterated phrase
in Hutchinson’s novel, <cite>This Freedom</cite>, “men that
marry for a home” might imply, to make the husband
happy. It is, on the contrary, to make the
woman happy, and the children, so that the marriages
of the future may be happier than those of
the present.</p>

<p>It will be shown that the husband not only can,
if he knows how, but must, if he wishes to be happy
himself, first see to it that discontent is an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thing. It is in his hands solely. His wife has practically
nothing to do with it. The dependence of
the woman on the man for erotic life is as absolute
as that of the newborn infant on the mother for
nutrition.</p>

<p>The concept of romantic love, like that of love
at first sight, contains the implication that love and
especially married love depends more upon what
Fate or Destiny vouchsafes to the man than upon
what he takes from Fate or creates for himself.
The taking and creating is certainly the prerogative
of the man while yet it may not necessarily belong to
the woman.</p>

<h3 id="section16">§ 16</h3>

<p>That is the essential difference between the masculine
and the feminine nature. It is masculine to
give and to create and to change external reality.
It is feminine to receive, and to respond to the
activity of the male. It is feminine to be thrilled at
the effects produced upon the wife by her husband’s
activities in every sphere of action. It is masculine to
be thrilled only by the resultant ecstasies of the wife.
It is not masculine to be emotionally impressed except
by the results of his own individual and particular
actions: results effected in other persons and
things.</p>

<p>This is the essential masculinity and femininity
assumed in this book. It will be evident to those
acquainted with modern psychology that the reverse
of these conditions implies the interchange of masculine
and feminine psychic natures.</p>

<p>For example the man who should (and yet not a
few do) derive his satisfactions solely from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
emotions aroused in him by the actions of other persons
and things is not truly masculine. His love
could not in any real sense be called virile.</p>

<h3 id="section17">§ 17</h3>

<p>Virile love is the only love that a man should
have—the only feeling a real man <em>can</em> have—for a
woman. Indeed, it is the only way a man loves a
woman if he is truly to be said to <em>love</em> her. Any
so-called love depending on being charmed by a
woman is essentially effeminate, not virile. The
moment he surrenders to her <em>charm</em>, he is not a man
but an autoerotic<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> child. <em>He</em> should absolutely and
positively charm <em>her</em>. There is no disgrace, no lack
of true femininity in a woman’s yielding to the power
a man must exercise over her erotic instincts. The
power is strictly a one-way power, exerted by the
man upon the woman if, and only as long as, he remains
man and she remains woman. The bisexual
nature of both man and woman often permits a
couple to reverse this direction of power influence.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If the wife’s charm is the only binding factor in
a marriage the marriage is doomed to dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
actually or potentially. And in order to maintain
this merely superficial charm, which no real man
needs to feel in a woman, she is obliged to resort to
all varieties of artifice from the lip stick and the
exotic perfume upward to the forced attempt to be
intellectually frank and interesting. Woman as
woman has no need for this artifice to maintain
charm for primordial man.</p>

<p>It may be that man at the present day is not
primordial superficially. But fundamentally he is
and so is woman primordial woman, and for all the
civilization which is only conscious, the ninety per
cent more or less of unconscious action and being
in the man acts upon and is inevitably and automatically
reacted to by the woman; and any survey
of the totality of the relations between them is incomplete
if it does not recognize and control the
almost unlimited energy of the primordial man and
woman beneath the surface. The difficulty is that
this recognition is a task; and most married couples
attempt to hide it both from themselves and from
each other. In such actions of the woman as are
dominated, as most conscious acts are, by the egoistic-social<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
impulse, any artifice, great or small, as
the case may be, is inevitably registered, to the
woman’s detriment, in the unconscious records of
the man.</p>

<p>“Does she,” the unconscious says, “really <em>need</em>
these embellishments, or does she only <em>think</em> she
needs them? If she really needs them, I have reels
of mental moving pictures of women who do not.
If she only thinks so, what have I failed to do that
should inspire her confidence, or prevent her from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
unconsciously trying to attract the autoerotic glances
of other men? I must adjust her up to a greater
height of erotic exaltation. Possibly that is the
fundamental reason. If she were actually my erotic
counterpart the idea would not even unconsciously
enter her mind to improve herself in this showy
manner. I must remove this tendency from her.”</p>

<p>Of course the husband likes to have his wife appear
attractive to him; but that does not require any
branch of the cosmetic art except what she can do
without drugs, pastes, powders and other mechanical
aids. Of course he wants her to interest him mentally
but that does not require her to do or say anything
spectacular or anything that has any “news
value.”</p>

<p>In her own femininity (which by the way is never
enhanced but only lessened by strenuous efforts to
appear charming either to himself or others), he
has the field which he can, and will, in proportion
to his psychic virility, cultivate into his own particular
Garden of Eden. In her own essential
womanliness he has the ground where he can plant
and build, without external aid, the garden and the
mansion, the work of his own hands, according to
his own design, the outward expression of all that
is fine and masculine in his own imagination. Any
failure in the execution of this plan is due to the
shaking of his own hand, the lack of attention on
his own part to the necessary details.</p>

<h3 id="section18">§ 18</h3>

<p>Arnold Bennett (in <cite>Pictorial Review</cite>, November
1922), writes: “She absolutely must exercise charm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
whether things are going right or going wrong....
Women were born to exercise charm.... A large
proportion of women, especially pretty ones, suffer
from the illusion that in order to exercise charm
they need only continue to exist. A mistake! To
exercise charm is an active and not a passive function.
It cannot be efficiently done without thought
and hard work. It is sometimes very trying and
exhausting, like earning money—but it is not less
essential than earning money if life is to be fully
lived.”</p>

<p>Many women prefer to earn money rather than
follow this unremunerative trade of exercising
charm; because they realize that earning money is
productive and exercising charm is not. They can
get in dollars a measure of their efforts. In personal
charm, however, there is no measurable factor,
except in reaction on the male, and that is an autoerotic
element in his mental make-up.</p>

<p>Feminine charm is to be sure active and not
passive. It is, however, reactive and not spontaneously
active. It reacts to the positive action of
the man, which is the response characteristic of true
femininity anywhere, any time. As to its necessitating
thought and hard work and being trying and
exhausting, the contrary is the truth. No man can
but dislike a woman who has thought and worked
hard, been tried and become <em>exhausted</em> by this thoroughly
artificial and unnatural attempt to “exercise
charm.” His unconscious and real reaction to this
trying position into which the woman puts herself
to retain his affection by exercising charm is one
of revolt. He may not know it but it is there all the
time, and comes out in the unhappy moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And this attempt recommended by Mr. Bennett
is only a superficial attempt. It never really succeeds
permanently. It is the reason why men avoid designing
women. They say to themselves unconsciously
that this forced effort is an overcompensation for
a real (i.e., unconsciously perceived) inferiority.</p>

<p>The only thing rightly to be called charm is the
pleasantness of the natural reaction on the woman’s
part to the binary situation, the situation of man
and woman in social intercourse. Her forcing herself
is always repugnant to him, if he is normally
himself. The word charm,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> therefore, applies to
a type or action on her part that is conditioned solely
on her being with him. It is character and conduct,
ingenuous, instinctive, spontaneous; revealing, without
traditional or conventional inhibitions, the
essence of true womanliness, and brought out only
in the situation that is really, and in the highest sense,
erotic, where the erotic holds sway over the more
ignoble egoistic-social impulse.</p>

<p>Her charm for her husband will consist in the
fact that she is woman and wife first and foremost.
That is enough for a man who is first and foremost
man and husband. Uninhibited woman, unwarped by
sex inhibitions, spontaneously making her direct
response, her natural reaction uninterrupted, unperverted,
unbroken by archaic traditions that have
overweighted the egoistic social instincts and debased
the erotic—such a woman has and will always
have the maximum of charm for unperverted man.
The eternal femininity, the universal femininity, is
always at the core of every woman’s being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Virile love alone is competent to tear away the
impediments that perturb its reactions, and when
this is done true monogamy is inevitable, for there
is no preventive mechanism obstructing the total
fusion of their bodies and souls. That kind of
charm any woman naturally exerts over any man, but
it has nothing in common with the conventional
charm of the cosmetic and costumer’s art.</p>

<p>The monogamic husband, if he reads beneath
the surface, feels this charm in all other women as
well as in his wife; but, as he knows what it amounts
to in care and attention, to uncover the soul of his
wife, he realizes that to undertake the task with
another woman would not be worth the candle. He
<em>could do it</em>, but he knows he would get no more
satisfaction from another woman than from his
wife.</p>

<h3 id="section19">§ 19</h3>

<p>In the sense of the universal and eternal feminine
charm being exerted upon the primordial masculine,
love is always love at first sight. But the reason
that love at first sight becomes hate at second or
closer sight is just this inability of the man to play
the truly virile part. What has charmed him at first
sight no longer charms him simply because all charm
exerted upon him produces in him the autoerotic
mental reaction. Only the first sight should produce
that result. If the second look is not accompanied by
the desire to dominate and to explore the depths
of the soul behind that face, it is the look not of a
virile man but of an autoerotic boy. And the boy
goes on being charmed by the face; or stops being
charmed and is antagonized. She will antagonize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
him actively and positively, of course, if, in due
season, she does not sense in him the virile action.
With her hostility aroused by this unconscious sense
of his weakness felt by her, he is disgusted naturally
and looks for another face.</p>

<p>The modern hologamous marriage is the creative
work of a virile man, a work that, as do all vital
things, needs constantly to be kept up. No overgrown
boy will be able to accomplish this virile work,
for being mostly brought up by women, he will not
know what <em>is</em> the real work of virile man in marriage.</p>

<p>The marriages that run down, those in which the
egoistic-social or material impulses gain the ascendancy
over the erotic or spiritual impulses, are the
marriages of autoerotic boys, not of virile men.</p>

<p>Psychic virility of the husband in the marital
relation is the only factor that can insure the permanence,
except superficially, of any marriage. “Love
is not love which alters when it alteration finds.”</p>

<p>There should be alteration in love, but it should
be caused by the progressive development of the
husband’s love. This is the theory of relativity
applied in the erotic sphere. Love should not alter
when—that is, because—it finds alteration; but it
should make changes in the reactions of the wife, so
that each year finds the married lovers more completely
fused physically and spiritually than the year
before.</p>

<p>From the woman’s point of view, she is invited by
marriage to a banquet, at which she may reasonably
expect to find a variety of comestibles all of adult
characteristics. If at this banquet she is served by
her husband only with milk or pap she is rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
revolted, and will not eat. Milk alternating with
pap in successive courses of marital banquet would
be cruelty and adequate cause for separation, if their
exclusive presence could be attributed to the voluntarily
malevolent choice of the husband. But in
most cases it is merely his ignorance for which his
parents and teachers are the blameless cause.</p>

<h3 id="section20">§ 20</h3>

<p>Is there any clearer truth than that all autoerotic
practices in the marital union are unmanly? And
is there any statement more incontrovertible than
that the average husband who has not taken the
trouble to know and control his wife in the erotic
sphere is unequivocally autoerotic mentally?</p>

<p>Can it be doubted that the average woman has
no possible means of knowing whether her suitor
will, after marriage, be an autoerotic boy or virile
man? Can we blame her if she is forced by our
crazy laws to make this a trial marriage, divorce
him if she can, and make another trial? Can we
blame anyone for taking food if she is starving and
call her act stealing? Not unless we have made it
perfectly plain to her how and where she may legitimately
obtain food. But we can blame the man,
for he is, he always has been, and he always will be
the provider of erotic power. A man has no right
to undertake the erotic support of any woman, and
then proceed to starve her and incontinently to
fatten himself upon her. Universally such a man
is scorned and always will be, except by women
whose erotic instincts have been overgrown and
overwhelmed by the egoistic-social impulses of conventionality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
These do not scorn a man who resorts
to prostitutes to feed his autoerotic appetites, or
who keeps mistresses or has other illicit liaisons for
the same purposes.</p>

<p>The moment an anthropoid human realizes what
he is <em>getting</em> from the promiscuous relations, and
that he is autoerotically getting in a <em>puerile</em> way
instead of giving in a <em>virile</em> way, he takes no more
interest whatever in the promiscuous relation. The
reply to an obvious objection here is that if he
finds his wife lacking in passion it means he has
not learned to know his wife, and, if he thinks he
finds more passion in the extra-marital woman, he
is either deceiving himself or being deceived by her,
the extra-marital one; and that he is <em>sexually as
anesthetic to all women</em> as he fancies his wife to be
anesthetic to him.</p>

<p>Unless she is a chronic invalid he has no justification
in thinking that passion is impossible between
them. He has not the knowledge of himself wherewith
to develop in himself enough virility to awaken
her erotic instincts. When once awakened these
will adequately satisfy him. If he has not aroused
them in his wife there is little chance that he will
arouse a real feeling in other women. If he cannot
consistently be satisfied with one woman and believes
that men are incurably polygamous, let him,
first, be sure to sound his wife’s erotism to the
bottom, and he will then need no other woman nor
fatuously imagine he wants another. This is the
surest cure for the polygamous-nature-of-man
delusion.</p>

<p>The errant husband may think he roves in search
of a real woman. As husband he has a real woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by his side; but, having a real woman as near to
him as he can bring himself to approach, he wanders
forth in search of an imaginary woman, who does
not exist in reality. There is no such thing as the
imaginary woman except in his mind. His virile
function is to make over this real woman at his
side according to the mental pattern he has of
woman as she should be, and within reasonable
limits he can do it, if he has the virile strength to
control his own emotions in her presence. If he
cannot do it in hers he cannot do it in another
woman’s, just because he has failed to do so in
his wife’s.</p>

<p>The answer will of course be made that a man
may marry a shrew. To this the reply is that a shrew
like Katharine in Shakespeare’s play is a woman
who has not been taught to love as every wife should
be. A shrew is simply a woman not yet erotically
developed. It may, to be sure, take a more than
ordinarily ardent lover to develop such a woman, but
barring the exceedingly rare cases of women in whom
love is a physical impossibility, the shrewishness of
a woman is only a measure of the inadequacy of the
husband. Except for the sporadic freaks of nature
there is no such thing as an impossible woman.</p>

<h3 id="section21">§ 21</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Mutuality</i></p>

<p>In the minds of young lovers no doubt exists
that their love should be mutual. The doubt comes
later in their married life that possibly some impediment
either existed in a latent state before they
were married and has developed since, so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ceased to be mutual; or, not previously existing,
was developed by some factor in their later married
life unforeseen in their earlier days and therefore
impossible to avoid.</p>

<p>In the creation and maintenance of mutuality in
the early married life the young husband is the
only one concerned. If there is real mutuality
caused by a perfect response in his bride, he can
maintain it only if he knows how he has gained it.
If it was gained by merely instinctive actions on his
own part, and if he is impressed by the beauty of
the mystery, and repeats to himself how wonderful it
is, and how inexplicable to have so warm a response,
he will not have a good chance of continuing it.
He will have to do what he has not yet done. Consciously,
and purposefully, he will observe his wife’s
reactions during the entirety of the love episode;
that is, from the beginning of one quite through to
the beginning of the next one, not merely the period
of the highest level of erotic excitement.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of woman to remain autoerotic
in her reactions. She may or may not rise to
allerotic action during her entire life. But man can
never succeed in the marital life if he remains autoerotic.
His first reactions to the marital situation
are necessarily autoerotic. He cannot avoid that.
His previous experience with women, if any, and
particularly with prostitutes, gives him at first little
if any opportunity to be with his wife other than
essentially autoerotic in his reactions. A man’s first
experience of a woman in an attempt at a love
episode is invariably a bath of absolutely new sensations,
a plunge into a sea of diverse stimuli, a
medium in which many men flounder for the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of their lives, gaining each time no more
than an uncoördinated congeries of external excitement
in which they act in no controlling manner.
Such men never mate a woman in the highest sense.
They only supply her with a child in the guise of
a husband. There is no mutuality between the surf
and the bather who is helplessly tossed about in
the breakers and is finally washed up on the shore
and left breathless by his contact with the countless
laughter of the sea.</p>

<p>Mutuality in the love episode depends solely on
the husband’s ability to control the situation. There
is no real mutuality in a relation where the wife is
merely a dispenser of physical delights to a husband
that neither knows nor cares what he himself contributes
to the situation, who immerses himself
totally in his own sensations. He is deaf, blind
and otherwise anesthetic to what he himself can
accomplish in the line of studied and foreplanned
effects of his own, self-initiated (not merely instinctive
and automatic reflex) actions upon his
wife. True, there are many women who expect no
more of a man than just this automatic autoerotism.
But, sooner or later, even though unconsciously,
they perceive a lack of “some amorous rite or other”
and their own passion cools, if it has had any
warmth. There is no mutuality here.</p>

<h3 id="section22">§ 22</h3>

<p>Mutuality does not exist where the wife has no
alternative other than the autoerotic reaction of the
husband. But in spite of an unchanging autoerotic
disposition of the wife, mutuality may be absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
secured by the instructed husband. As indicated
below, the average honeymoon should see the beginning
of the end of mental autoerotic reactions
on the part of the groom.</p>

<p>Even the groom that has had previous sex experience
is in his early marriage in an erotic situation
which is essentially new to him—a situation that
contains elements the like of which he never could
have experienced before. The inevitable novelty
of these new elements is a condition, on his part, of
perceiving all new sensations, practically of having
unprecedented things done to him.</p>

<p>The things done to him are more numerous and
newer than anything in all his previous experience.
In this sense, then, he is by force of circumstances
placed upon an autoerotic level, from which it is his
imperative duty to ascend in order that by his
control of his own erotic reactions he may control
those of his wife. No apology is needed for an
initial autoerotic response on the newly wedded husband’s
part.</p>

<p>It might be said that in the situation of bride and
groom each having things done to them by the
other, rather than positively doing things to each
other, there might be a situation of perfect mutuality.
But if it is, it never remains any longer than
the duration of a honeymoon, for the essential
femininity of the woman demands that in the erotic
sphere alone, she be led, and with no uncertain
guidance.</p>

<p>The honeymoon ends automatically when this
point is reached; and the condition of true mutuality
in perfect marital relations ensues if the husband
has a virile love of his wife and takes the lead. If
his love is not virile, but merely autoerotic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
puerile, he never assumes this leadership, and his
wife becomes more and more unresponsive to him,
simply because the only type of activity to which
she can respond is an erotic virility, a true manliness
that contains the real essence of masculinity which
is the imperative necessity to control the entire
erotic life of one woman.</p>

<h3 id="section23">§ 23</h3>

<p>It should not be assumed that these remarks
about the honeymoon imply that all honeymoons or
even any of them are failures. The failures, if
such appear, are only apparent, and need not necessarily
be real; for their success is always within reach
of the husband who needs only knowledge and confidence.
His one aim is the proper response of his
wife, and that is his only needful success. If he
uses intelligence and acquires knowledge (and the
honeymoon is the source of his knowledge of the
extent of his wife’s inhibitions, negativisms and resistances)
his progress is limited only by the small
amount of his love. If he has love enough, which
includes a determination to win, he will succeed.
And it should be remembered that a woman’s consent
to marry is not her admission that she has
been won, but only her consent to let the man win
her thereafter, if he can.</p>

<p>When this control is properly assumed by the
mentally and spiritually virile husband, real mutuality
begins in the marital life. The husband now
conquers his unavoidable initial autoerotic habit of
mind and thought, and at the same time becomes
a truly social being, realizing that by his own self-control
alone, in the love episode, which absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
assures his wife’s complete erotic affiliation with him,
he is securing the only kind of mutuality worthy of
the name.</p>

<p>It is obvious that <em>this</em> mutuality is reciprocal in a
sense entirely different from any mutuality that
could be attributed to the relation during the honeymoon
stage. He knows now what erotically emotional
effects he can produce on his wife during the
love episodes, and exactly how he has produced
them. Beyond any doubt whatsoever, he also knows
from the most intimate experience that the production
of these effects is the only real mutuality.</p>

<p>An effect, in the erotic sphere, produced in a husband
by a wife, is one from which all truly virile
men realize they gain only autoerotic pleasure. To
this effect they contribute themselves nothing. In
the end the wife gets nothing of the emotional
catharsis which is the <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> of true marital
living. In such circumstances the wife gives and
the husband receives, certainly a gross disgrace if
it be continued, a disgrace abhorred by all men.
There is no mutuality in such a gift which but
impoverishes the recipient.</p>

<p>It thus appears that in the marital relation the
husband alone is the one rightly to be the giver.
And his gift impoverishes neither himself nor his
wife, the recipient, but paradoxically enriches both.
The husband rightly gives his time, his attention,
his love and thereby controls. But in order to do
this he has to control himself absolutely, so as not
to snatch away from both of them that of which
nature has designed him to be the donor.</p>

<p>Mutuality requires the husband to be sure to get
something, but the thing he can get is the erotic
acme of his wife, and this is the only result that, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the spiritually and mentally virile husband, has any
value whatever. If, on the other hand, he takes
his own erotic relaxation without getting hers it is
merely a half gift which he forces, or persuades, her
to give him, and mutuality is out of the question.</p>

<h3 id="section24">§ 24</h3>

<p>The idea of compensation or barter or <i lang="la">quid pro
quo</i> must be rigidly excluded from the concept of
mutuality; for this measuring of the balance of
values of the actual physical performances or even
intellectual attainments rests for its validity on the
inevitable comparisons which are the basis of all
values for the egoistic-social activities. To the greatest
erotic success these comparisons are utterly
antagonistic. In the erotic sphere, as is later noted,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
comparisons are not merely odious, but logically
impossible. There can be no balancing of giving
and taking.</p>

<p>From one point of view, the husband cannot but
give all and receive nothing, at least of the character
of that which he gives. He gives an emotional
reaction to a woman, which no other man can
give.</p>

<p>He cannot in return reproduce in himself the
emotional reaction of a woman. He cannot react
as a woman reacts, if he be a virile lover, for such
a reaction, though common enough in run-down
marriages, is not the emotional reaction of a man.
If his bisexuality leads him to approximate this
feminine reaction, he is to that extent himself feminine
and not masculine.</p>

<p>One should not, however, ignore the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
both men and women are normally bisexual to a
slight extent, and to that degree woman will desire
to exercise some control in the erotic sphere, even
if it be only to create in her mate the most complete
erotic effects. Also, if a woman with a comparatively
large proportion of masculinity in her nature
be married to a man with an equal proportion of
femininity, a happy marriage may result, if no other
adverse elements enter.</p>

<p>But in general it will be admitted that the husband
cannot rightly seek for himself the type of erotic
reaction which is proper and peculiar to his wife;
though it must be confessed that the suggestions
operative even in the average married love episode
are strongly that way. The husband hears the
ecstatic responses of his wife and her repeated inquiries
as to his own pleasurable sensations, and the
whole situation is such as to suggest to him that he
identify in every respect his own feelings with hers.</p>

<p>But to do so is in no degree to make for true
mutuality. His own feelings should not be the
utter surrender and abandon to physical and mental
bliss which he sees so profoundly moving to his
partner. His feeling should be a pervading sense
of triumph and accomplishment, no less profound
for being embedded in sensual gratification. The
truth is that biologically the wife has no positive
accomplishment to perform in the love episode; for
the only accomplishment of which she is capable
is the utter dissolution, temporary though it be, of
the personality of her husband. If she succeeds,
she is in the position of one who, not knowing, should
try, by applying a match, to see whether or not
gunpowder is inflammable. It is, and she is carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
kept in ignorance of the fact, but plentifully supplied
with matches.</p>

<p>If this quite easy accomplishment of the wife is
successfully performed, she has no husband left, at
least for a while, and the explosion has ruined her
own chance of happiness, until more explosive is
provided.</p>

<p>The husband’s unequivocal task, therefore, which
alone assures his erotically supporting his wife is
rigidly to remain uninflammable until she, metaphorically
speaking, is in ashes herself. For this
scientific reduction of the modern wife, the modern
husband needs, for he rarely finds it instinctively, the
help of the present-day technique of love as taught
by the best erotologists.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This will enable him to avoid being consumed to
a condition where he is no longer able to produce
any effect at the very time when an effect is most
loudly clamored for by nature.</p>

<p>The quick ignition of explosive powder produces
only a puff and a flash, but the wife desires no flashlight
of that type but a guiding star.</p>

<p>True mutuality, therefore, cannot be present in
a couple where the husband does not reverse this
process and absolutely retain his own emotional
tension until her erotic acme has taken place. It
cannot be too often repeated that the only means of
securing the wife’s emotional catharsis in the acme of
the love episode is the husband’s remaining tense and
unrelaxed, avoiding his own emotional catharsis
until hers is, beyond the peradventure of a doubt,
secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section25">§ 25</h3>

<p>An absolutely novel and unprecedented result
follows the successful accomplishment of this erotically
virile performance.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The husband gains a
relaxation of all his tensions; the most important
of all, and the greatest, being that relaxation of his
caused by the total relaxation of his wife’s erotic
tension. A good part of his own tension is caused
by his knowledge of hers.</p>

<p>The even unconscious knowledge that this has
not been accomplished is the little rift within the
lute of married life that increases until their relations
eventually become no longer sweet bells, but
jangled out of tune and harsh. No matter how
much intellectual congeniality there may be between
the married partners, which is a factor more egoistic-social
than erotic, this lack of unconscious rapport is
actually sensed, though not directly. With characteristically
human proclivity to rationalize (instead
of to know facts and to reason from them), husband
and wife begin to disagree upon points apparently
most remote from anything erotic, as for example
the position of pieces of furniture in the house, or
the thousand and one details of solely egoistic-social
import.</p>

<p>This does not mean at all that they are not going
to have differences of opinion. On the contrary,
honest differences of opinion and taste are to be
acknowledged by each as proof of the other’s positiveness
of character; and the surprises caused in the
husband by the unexpected reactions of his wife to
all sorts of situations, chiefly egoistic-social ones, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
part of the variety which is the spice of marital
living.</p>

<p>They congratulate themselves that their disagreements
and disputes do not concern really fundamental
things, though if they but knew it, there would be
now, as there once was (but they have forgotten),
no question raised about such matters simply because
such matters do not belong to the sphere of marital
erotism.</p>

<p>Complete erotic mutuality based on the proper
“firing order” of the love emotions of husband and
wife, distinctly separates and keeps separate and
apart from the single erotic sphere, where the twain
are one flesh, their two individual spheres of their
separate egoistic-social impulses and activities. The
husband leaves unquestioned all of these activities
of his wife and vice versa.</p>

<p>There thus emerges with increasing clearness the
prime importance of the distinction between erotic
and egoistic-social impulses and activities, and with
this distinction grows the unalterable conviction,
from every aspect of human values, of the unquestionable
superiority of the erotic sphere over the
egoistic-social spheres.</p>

<p>It is a matter of scientific proof of the last few
years, too, that in the married relation this ascendancy
of the erotic over the egoistic-social sphere is
not only conducive to the greatest health, happiness
and longevity but also productive of the greatest
material success. The most successful men and
women, from every point of view from the material
to the spiritual, are the men who have secured, and
the women who have experienced, this truly human
erotic mutuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section26">§ 26</h3>

<p>It is the object of the present volume to point out
that the non-existence of the erotic acme in the wife
is an inexcusable condition, that can be remedied,
and that its substitution by the ability of the husband
to insure the acme in the wife as often as she desires
it is a condition of the true physical and spiritual
progress which should mark the present century.</p>

<p>Nothing could seem further from the truly American
ideal of a good “sport” than that there should be
men who will take all and give nothing. No excuse
is accepted of men who enter a game, and, as soon as
they are in, become paralyzed and unable to do a
single thing except shout about their membership on
the team. But that is exactly what the average husband
does in his marriage. He marries mostly to
get something for nothing in sex life and he finds out
later that the something turns out to be nothing.
Who is to blame but himself?</p>

<p>He makes innumerable excuses for his failure,
excuses sometimes handed out to him by physicians.
He is a man and men are known to be hasty in the
love episode. Civilized men always are and have
been. There is no help for it. Their wives must
make themselves content with the crumbs that fall
from the husband’s table. It is injurious for men to
change in any way or degree their instinctive reactions.
Postponement or doing without their own
erotic acme acts in such a way as to constitute a strain
on the man’s nervous system. All these false statements
have been made by different people at different
times.</p>

<p>The necessary control on the man’s part is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to attain, and once attained it is easy to maintain.
But it depends upon a fundamental rearrangement
of all values for the man such that the greatest value
for him is not in the pleasurable sensations that he
himself gets out of his relations with his wife but in
the gratifications, totally different in sense quality,
that come from the sense of triumph over resistances
that is experienced by him when he has for the
first time attained, or finally has secured, such control
over himself that he can thereby control the
emotional specifically erotic reactions of his wife.</p>

<p>If a man’s deepest unconscious satisfactions came
from being emotionally controlled by a woman he
would never learn to control hers. The unconscious
satisfactions invariably are felt when control over
the woman’s erotic responses is held by the man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is a level of unconscious reaction
causing feelings of gratification that even in
men come from being controlled. More will be said
about this later. Instinctively in many boys this control
is thrown off. They rebel against paternal
authority. They scorn being managed by girls.
They prefer to be themselves and act their own acts
and derive satisfaction from the effects of those acts
upon the persons or things of the external world.</p>

<p>Yet the fact that all individuals of both sexes,
when infants and children, are dependent, and can
gain satisfaction and relaxations of tensions of desire
never by means of their own acts but only by means
of the acts of others, makes it quite evident that there
will be a tendency, stronger in some than in others,
to get in post-pubertal life their satisfactions via the
old route—the satisfactions that come from having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
things done to them and not from doing things for
other people and observing the results.</p>

<p>There are two sources of satisfaction in every
human, the infantile one which may be called passive
and the adult male which may be called the active
source or the source of satisfaction from the effects
of one’s own action.</p>

<h3 id="section27">§ 27</h3>

<p>It is not to be overlooked that the satisfaction
derived from the effect of one’s own action may be
due to an unconscious magnifying of these effects.
Those who have a slight degree of discriminative
ability will think that their acts and the results of
their acts are fine, whether they are or not, and may
remain in the same illusion throughout their lives.
They may never become disillusioned. I may continue
to believe that the effects produced on my
readers are deep and far-reaching whether they are
or not. But if I were content to read books and
listen to lectures and felt no desire to write and to
influence others or to persuade them to see things
as I see them I should derive all my satisfactions via
the route of passive experiences.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference, then, between
the essentially masculine and the essentially feminine
type of character, according as the individual gets
his satisfactions—the relaxations of his tensions of
desire—via the route of feelings caused in him by
the action of others or via the route of feelings
caused in him by the true and illusionless perception
that he has produced effects in other persons or in
other things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The rearrangement of values is the transition
from a frame of mind in which the satisfactions are
via the “passive” route to those via the active route.
This rearrangement need never, for any biological
reason, take place in a woman who is properly mated.
If she be married but not mated by a male individual
who has not made the above-mentioned transition,
she will herself tend toward getting her satisfaction
via the “active” or “male” route. In other words,
rather than have nothing, she deludes herself into
thinking she has something by getting a cheapened
substitute, by becoming husband to her husband, who
in turn becomes wife.</p>

<p>No man can be said to be successful as a husband
who has not made this transition. No man is exempt
from the necessity of the transition from this type
of physical autoerotism to allerotism, simply because
he was once an infant, and until he makes this
transition he is, no matter what his age in years, still
an infant. It has been undeniably proved by psychoanalysis
and experienced by people in innumerable
forms that no woman can be dominated by an infantile
man.</p>

<p>Therefore every man is either the one or the
other; either an adult man or an infantile man. He
can by taking thought, and after reading books like
the present, learn to which class he belongs. If he
belongs in the infantile class he has been dominated
by the “mother imago” or “angel imago,”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and if
this be a fixation it will require a deep analysis by an
expert before he can come to a realization of his true
status; but it is unlikely that nine out of ten who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
read this book will require more than the advice
offered in the following chapters. Or it will require
a good orientation and suggestive treatment from a
well equipped erotologist.</p>

<p>No wife can be a thoroughly happy one whose
husband is in the infantile class, and who thus needs
her “playmate.” (See <a href="#section12">§ 12</a>.) Such women are
truly in a tragic situation. The infantile (autoerotic)
behaviour of such a man in the fragmentary
(never complete) love episodes leaves the woman
nervous, “on edge,” with an unconscious conflict
in her psyche that tends to undermine her health,
and to make her an insuperable mystery to her husband,
who himself suffers through his own ignorance.
He knows, if he knows anything, only that
something is amiss, but blinded by his own egotism
can never believe that the cause lies solely in him, no
matter how blameless he may be, from one point of
view, on account of his ignorance.</p>

<h3 id="section28">§ 28</h3>

<p>To return then to the proposition with which we
started: If the man believes that the woman can by
her action evoke his erotic acme, she can. He should
know and believe that she cannot; unless he knows
she is going to arrive at her erotic acme at the same
time he does. But no man can ever be absolutely
sure of that, particularly if his egoistic-social impulses
are inordinately active and she has few if any
such activities, comparatively, and more leisure to
follow erotic impulses.</p>

<p>The autoerotic condition in a man is the cause of
his haste in the love episode, as his attention is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
primarily centered on his own sensations that he excludes
the possibility of his observation of his wife’s
reactions in the most intimate of marital relations.
If the husband is hasty, he is <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> mentally
autoerotic. His haste is caused by his mental autoerotism.
In blunt language he loves himself more
than his wife. He may love the results she produces
in his feelings. What he needs is to learn how to
love more, to be more passionate, to go deeper into
the nature of erotism, into the study of the woman,
his wife, and her individuality, particularly her
unconscious reactions to him.</p>

<p>The thought, “I can control the most elusive
thing in the universe—a woman’s erotism,” is the
most triumphant thought that can occur to a man,
except possibly the thought, “And I know how to
continue to control it.” It is almost equivalent and
is analogous in many respects to an ability to overcome
gravitation and propel oneself at will through
the air at any desired speed.</p>

<h3 id="section29">§ 29</h3>

<p>In this connection it must be emphasized that control
of the erotic situation by the husband is absolutely
and unequivocally mental.</p>

<p>In order also to give due weight to the reply to an
objection that might be made here, two new terms
will be proposed. The objection is that the distinction
between mental and physical is purely arbitrary,
so it is futile to say that the control is exclusively
mental, because the exclusively mental does not exist.
Mind, apart from body, is non-existent.</p>

<p>The answer: All phenomena into which a so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mental element enters can be graded into what would
be called without objection on the part of anyone,
more mental or less mental, meaning, of course, consciously
mental. Thus digestion is less mental than
phantasying or day-dreaming, and some emotions
might be called less mental than others.</p>

<p>But because we are required by everything that we
know about the mind-body combination, to suppose
that no so-called purely mental state is without its
physical substratum without which it would not exist,
and because no physiological process is totally outside
of all causal connection with the mind, we are
justified in saying that mind is more highly organized
body, and body less highly organized mind.</p>

<p>Regarding then any human phenomenon as conditioned
by both mental and physical causes we can
remove the difficulty, and at the same time the objection
that is being answered here, by adopting three
Greek words and coining two new English words
from them.</p>

<p><em>Soma</em> is the Greek for <em>body</em>; <em>hyper</em> for <em>upper</em>, or
<em>above</em>; and <em>hypo</em> for <em>under</em> or <em>below</em>. So we may call
the ordinary physiological movements and processes
<em>hyposomatic</em> or a lower form of action of the mind-body
combination. Similarly we may use the name
<em>hypersomatic</em> for the various degrees of mentality.
From the point of view of this book all human action
is somatic. Some of it such as digestion, glandular
secretion, is hyposomatic or at one end of a series of
degrees of complexity. Some human action is hypersomatic,
such as remembering. Some of the human
phenomena, like emotions, partake of both ends of
the series in apparently more or less equal proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section30">§ 30</h3>

<p>To return, then, after this digression, to the statement
that control is entirely mental: By this, of
course, is meant control according to a hypersomatic
pattern. There is no control without a pattern.
One never is said to control one’s actions unless he
has an idea according to which he is going to act.
Otherwise his actions are automatic—not controlled.</p>

<p>The immediate connection of this with our present
argument is this then (an argument that runs right
along with the ideas of autosuggestion): any man
can do what any man has done, if he has the same
hypersomatic pattern according to which his actions
are carried out.</p>

<p>An obvious objection will at once be made, but it
is only an apparent one. Many men will say they
know they are physically weak, or weak-willed, are
lacking in control. They know it because they have
<em>never</em> controlled their love emotions, and have <em>little</em>
control over any of their emotions.</p>

<p>To that excuse, the answer is: just because you
have not is no proof that you cannot. If that were
the case no progress would ever have been made
by humanity.</p>

<p>That you have not controlled yourself is proof
only that you have not yet vividly imagined a pattern
according to which your actions might be carried
out. The only hypersomatic pattern existing in your
personality is that according to which you are now
acting.</p>

<p>Countless biographies of men, great and less great,
demonstrate that there have been revolutionary,
cataclysmic changes in their actions resulting from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
alterations in the patterns, i.e., changes in the hypersomatic
end of their personality.</p>

<p>The man who says he cannot change his actions
is simply saying he cannot change his ideas. That
would be somewhat analogous to saying he cannot
learn a foreign language. But we know that everyone
going to a foreign country and being environed
month after month by a foreign language <em>will</em> learn
to speak it, whether he tries or not. How easily and
quickly he does is a matter only of his hypersomatic
elasticity. Some are more elastic than others, but
almost anyone who can walk can learn to change his
hypersomatic patterns, can in other words become
conscious of a new hypersomatic pattern, see its
superiority to an old one, and regulate and control
his actions accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="section31">§ 31</h3>

<p>Psychoanalysis has among other striking paradoxes
this one most applicable here. The person
who says he cannot do a thing is consciously saying,
“I cannot,” but unconsciously saying, “I do not
wish to.”</p>

<p>Any reply that can be made by any man who says
he cannot learn to control his own erotic emotions
and therefore is unable to control his wife’s is
excusing himself, on the ground that he will not be
censured by others if he is really unable. He may
be laughed at, or commiserated for his incapacities,
but he cannot, so he thinks, be held responsible for
them.</p>

<p>But if there is one important and valuable advance
made by modern psychology it is that the unconscious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which says, “I do not wish to,” causing the
conscious man to say, “I cannot”—this unconscious
can be trained, reëducated, reshaped, repatterned.
It may take more than a month. The final emergence
of action, based on the re-patterned unconscious, may
be sudden. But it can be done.</p>

<p>Those who say, “I cannot do it” are in their ignorance
simply saying, “I do not wish to do it.”</p>

<p>They would wish to do it if they had in their
minds—in the hypersomatic portion of their personalities—an
adequately vivid picture of exactly what
it is desired to do.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to put into a book a detailed
pattern of marital behaviour on the part of
husbands, particularly hyposomatic details. But it
is hoped that the book will give as clear an exposition
of the hypersomatic lineaments of the marital pattern
as will be required to make any man that reads
it at least willing to change his own love pattern for
one that has in it infinitely more satisfaction and
triumph, containing as it does the only means
whereby a single demi-human atom may completely
unite with another and form an entirely new whole.</p>

<h3 id="section32">§ 32</h3>

<p>As far as records are available there is no reason
to suppose that the champion shot-putter, prize-fighter,
or longshoreman is any more <em>able</em> to evoke
in his wife the climax of erotic ecstasy than is the
rather flat-chested, spectacled college professor,
the department store head, the banker, or any other
member of the so-called sedentary professions.</p>

<p>The latter class of people have unduly and illogically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
overvalued the hyposomatic end of the scale.
Woman can be courted and married (and thereafter
won!) by men whose strength is hypersomatic just
as well as by those whose strength is hyposomatic.
But so far as the physical or hyposomatic side of the
marital relation is concerned, there may be a difference
between the pugilist and the college professor
in the amount of egoistic-social development in comparison
with the amount of erotic development in
his past history.</p>

<p>After reading this chapter many people may feel
disappointed and say: “You have not told me
how I can insure my erotic self-control (or my
husband’s).”</p>

<p>I will anticipate somewhat by saying that the
affirmation “I know I can control,” if repeated
enough times a day with sufficient conviction would
undoubtedly help. If to this were added, “I know
I love my wife better than I do myself,” it would
also be a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>But for the material of the pattern on which is
based the conviction of the truth of man’s ability
to control himself, I shall have to refer the reader to
the later chapters in the book.</p>

<p>At first all I can hope to do is to convince some of
the men who read this book that they belong to the
infant class of husbands. If the men whose wives
are discontented or whose sweethearts are slow in
promising, can read and realize that the whole situation
is psychic or mental (hypersomatic) rather
than physical or economic (hyposomatic), they will
see that from one point of view their victory over
themselves, and incidentally over others, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
easiest thing in the world, far easier than to lift a
weight or change the colour of a leaf on a tree.</p>

<p>For the control recommended in this book no new
muscles or nerves have to be supplied, nor do any
actual muscles or ligaments or tendons have to be
exercised or otherwise strengthened. It would
be hard to go through a daily dozen or (gross) of
calisthenic exercises and still harder, indeed impossible,
to make hair grow (or not grow) where it did
not (or did) before. But the procedure to be recommended
in this book is more like opening one’s eyes,
and seeing that a vehicle is bearing down upon one
(or about to leave without one), than it is like walking
in an ethical treadmill and satisfying a sense of
duty by monotonous repetition of behaviour enforced
from without.</p>

<p>For the control advocated here nothing is needed
but a new picture of love, uncorrupted by the ignorance
of traditional lore and superstition. What is
needed is more creative imagination in married life,
not spoiled by cynicism or emasculated by fatalism.
Control can be secured!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">EMOTIONS</span></h2>

<h3 id="section33">§ 33</h3>

<p>Emotions, including moods and many nameless
feelings, are some of the innate organic sensations
evoked in our bodies by sensations that are not
organic. In other words, they form a part of the
internal sensations, which so far as generally named
are originally associated with external sensations.</p>

<p>Frink remarks that “the emotion, from the point
of view of physiology, <em>is</em> these various preparatory
changes in the content of the blood, in the innervation
of the various muscles, endocrine glands and
other viscera. The emotion, from the point of view
of psychology, is the afferent, sensory report of these
changes.” And William James’ classical statement is
as follows: “Bodily changes follow directly the perception
of the exciting fact, and our feeling of the
same changes as they occur <em>is</em> the emotion.... The
more rational statement is that we feel sorry because
we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we
tremble, and not that we cry, strike or tremble, because
we are sorry, angry or fearful, as the case
may be.”</p>

<p>While most emotions of the simple type, like surprise,
admiration, joy and others are in infancy and
childhood originally, though not innately associated
with certain definite sensations from the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
world, they are frequently reassociated by experience
through the influence of the environment, so that, in
later life, one enjoys or detests quite the opposite
of what caused instinctive attraction or repulsion in
early life.</p>

<p>The complex emotions of love, jealousy and hate
are not, in their greatest complexity, existent in
humans before puberty, although the unsynthetized
elements out of which they are finally composed are
present in childhood, particularly hate. This, according
to psychoanalysis, is a more archaic emotion
than love and is not its direct opposite. It is
likely that human emotions are progressing from a
dominant hatred toward a reigning love.</p>

<p>Love in its fully synthetic and complicated form
is not only impossible in children, but its higher
types, spoken of in this book as <em>erotic</em>, occur at their
best in those more intricately complicated personalities
that are the peculiar product of modern
civilization.</p>

<p>The expression of erotic emotion does not involve
activity on the man’s part solely, and absolute passivity
on the woman’s. Passion and passive are
etymologically the same word, but the natural inferences
from this are erroneous. It happened that
emotions were called passions by some old Roman
pseudo-philosopher who was translating Stoic doctrines
and used “passions” to translate <i>patheia</i>,
which, in Greek, means “sufferings.” The Stoics believed
that emotions were sufferings inflicted on men
by Fate. Their great discovery was that men could
conquer them by training (<i>askesis</i>). Hence comes
“asceticism”: the training by which a man might free
himself from the suffering which was caused by feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
anything. Now we are beginning to realize that
there are emotions that <em>ought</em> to be felt, and repeatedly—emotions
that are as necessary to the
growth of the soul as food is to the growth of the
body. Asceticism (training), therefore, of the future
will be a training in the emotions of love.</p>

<h3 id="section34">§ 34</h3>

<p>Women are said to be more emotional than men.
In the sense that their actions are guided by their
emotions more than by the verbal processes of logical
reasoning this may be true. For there is a type
of mental process that may be called logical in which
verbal consistency is sought and with little difficulty
maintained. But as words are only counters, symbols
or representatives of things and are used in
only a part of all the thinking, conscious and unconscious,
that goes on in the mind continuously day
and night, a term is needed with which to describe
the wordless thought-processes that are quite as important
causes of action as are the verbal processes;
and to these has been given the term psychological.</p>

<p>Emotions are for the most part indescribable, not
to be adequately represented by words, and are
therefore to be regarded as psychological processes
tendency to subject their mental processes to verbal
thought or reasoning.</p>

<p>Men are characterized more than women by a
tendency to subject their mental processes to verbal
control, while women utter many words in the vain
attempt to give verbal expression to their feelings.
In men on the average words have more weight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the determination of action; in women feelings or
emotions.</p>

<h3 id="section35">§ 35</h3>

<p>In the sense, however, that women perceive with
greater clearness and intensity the internal organic
sensations (or emotions) it is not true that women
are more emotional than men. Unconsciously,
“down deep in their hearts” the members of one sex
are as emotional as those of the other. Men have
as many and as powerful emotions as women, but
have controlled some emotions more than women
have, by annihilating or attempting to annihilate,
them by means of repression. But women too have
been forced to repress certain other emotions, notably
the erotic.</p>

<h3 id="section36">§ 36</h3>

<p>The most vital emotion is the erotic. I hope I
shall not be misunderstood in my use of the term
“erotic.” I place it above all the other emotions in
dignity and complexity. It is sex plus love and more
than that. “All the wonder and wealth of the mine
in the heart of one gem.” All the dynamics of the
ages in the force of one feeling. It is the physical
plus the spiritual, the combination of bodily and
psychical, the paradox that makes the individual’s
greatest personal happiness consist in his feeling the
happiness of another person of the opposite sex,
the spiritual force that vitalizes and sublimates every
physical thing it touches, the psychical that completely
evaporates, if not supported by the most
physical, an emotion that, unlike any other emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
comes from the experience not of other <em>things</em> but
of another’s <em>emotions</em>, the only emotion that
responds pleasurably to <em>every</em> manifestation of bodily
and spiritual activity of the member of the other
sex. Erotism is the most nearly perfect type of
conjugal love.</p>

<h3 id="section37">§ 37</h3>

<p>“After she has had sexual experiences,” Kisch
maintains, “a woman’s sexual emotions are just as
powerful as man’s, though she has more motives
than a man for controlling them.” (Ellis, <cite>Psychology
of Sex</cite>, Vol. III, p. 202.)</p>

<p>Her motives for controlling them, which here
means annihilating them or repressing them, are
egoistic-social ones (see <a href="#section43">§ 43</a>) just as man’s; but in
man-made society these motives are stronger in the
woman than in the man, because man has placed more
repression on her sex impulses than on his own.</p>

<p>In placing more repression on hers than on his,
he has not, however, given anywhere near a full
expression to his own erotic instincts. Because of
the dominance of egoistic-social impulses in modern
civilization his erotism does not permit the expression
of such fundamental strata of his unconscious
as are stirred in woman, whose more flexible erotism
is aroused to a pitch that he finds it difficult because
of his egoistic-social interests to ascend.</p>

<p>As is maintained steadfastly in this book, he
has repressed his own, but hers still more. In so
doing he has lowered the moral, spiritual and psychical
status of marriage, which should, if they two
are to become one flesh, accept the entire body as
well as the whole soul each of the other. In repressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
what he has deemed the physical side of love
man has put on himself a quite unnecessary burden.
With the natural desire to control, which constitutes
masculinity, he has, in his thinking, blunderingly
made annihilation an equivalent of control.</p>

<p>This placing of more repression on her erotism
than on his is due to the fact that his own is so
quickly satisfied in comparison with hers. He acts
en masse as if it would take so much of his time,
now devoted to egoistic-social ends, to equal, in
erotic expression, her greater capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="section38">§ 38</h3>

<p>The most striking fact of most emotions, except
those of love, is the facility with which they are
reassociated with ideas different from those with
which they first occurred.</p>

<p>The love emotions appear to be the least easily
transferred, as indeed they are the least easily
stirred to their depths. This is said advisedly on
the well grounded observation that most people who
say they love do not love fully, and deeply. The
more deeply they love, the more their passion instills
itself into every fibre of their being and the more
slowly they are able to change their love object.</p>

<p>But ordinary emotions, other than the erotic, are
readily and almost universally shifted from one object
to another. Indeed, it may be asserted that
there is no innate content of any of the emotions
except love. Love innately requires an object of
the opposite sex.</p>

<p>To illustrate the reassociability of the other emotions
it is necessary only to recall what things one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
has liked or feared years ago and compare them
with the present likes or fears.</p>

<p>And it would be enough to take fear itself as an
illustration of the variability of its content. When
fear becomes fixed in a phobia, it is extraordinary
how irrational the association is, viewed from any
logical standpoint. A woman fears mice or snakes,
although she has never been injured by either, or
beetles, although possibly she has never touched one.
Or she fears to cross an open square, and nearly
faints if she has to do so alone, although there is
not a chance in ten thousand that any harm would
come to her. An association of an emotion so profound
as fear with some chance place or occurrence
is ample proof that the emotions themselves have no
essential connection with any external object. The
absence of fear in some persons under circumstances
where people generally would be afraid also demonstrates
the ready dissociation of emotions from particular
experiences. One can learn to like or to
dislike almost anything.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this is true of love but far
less so if we restrict the use of the term “love” to its
more ideal phases. When we speak of “Off with the
old love and on with the new,” it will be conceded
that we speak not of true love but of a very shallow
interest.</p>

<h3 id="section39">§ 39</h3>

<p>A young woman, Miss F., married a man who
made an ideal lover and to whom she responded passionately;
but yet she was not happy with him. She
had in reality fallen in love more or less unconsciously
with a previous suitor. She frankly told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
her husband she could not love him fully, divorced
him and subsequently married her first lover.</p>

<p>One might say that, if the reassociation of love
emotions were as easy as that of most other emotions
the young woman might have learned to love
her husband. She evidently tried to do so, but she
made the mistake, made by many uninstructed young
women, of going against her better judgment in
marrying the man she did. Her first lover was not
in a financial condition to marry. She wanted to
marry, and took the first available man. So, as in
many cases, the fear of not getting married at all
forced her to take a man whom she did not love
<em>enough</em>. She must have been more or less conscious
of this all the time. She made, however, a definite
attempt to reassociate her love emotions. She was
not able to do it. Her husband, although he is
described as an ideal lover, was not able to arouse
her full passion.</p>

<h3 id="section40">§ 40</h3>

<p>Then there is the case of Mrs. G., who married
the prominent Dr. G. practically on a wager. She
did not love him, but in a spirit of bravado declared
to a girl friend that she could make him marry her.
Not himself being in absolute control of his own
erotism, he succumbed to her charm. Not knowing
also the part a husband is required to play in the
marital life in order to make it a success, he did not
make her love him, did not evoke in her the responses
which make a woman the object of a man’s deepest
passion. So, as in a great many marriages, he did
not really love her, and she divorced him after a
few years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Both women were unfortunate in their choice of
a man. The resultant divorces could have been
obviated by the knowledge neither man had. But
this is the history of most divorces where the couples
have come to grief on obstacles considered to be
erotic.</p>

<p>Neither of these women clearly distinguished between
egoistic-social and erotic motives because
neither of them had had erotic experiences, and in
their marriages they failed also to get the highest
type of erotic experience.</p>

<h3 id="section41">§ 41</h3>

<p>But it is impossible for any woman to know what
sort of erotic life will be hers with any man whom
she consents to marry. At present every marriage
is a trial marriage for a woman, and for the uninstructed
man as well. Only the marriage composed
of a woman and a fully prepared man can be said
to have any reasonable assurance of being permanent.</p>

<p>The other emotions than love are readily transferred
from one object to another. Love is not
easily transferred as, primarily, it has only one object,
the human of the opposite sex, and where the
love in question is the elaborately developed love,
that has its roots deep in the erotic soil of the unconscious
of both partners, which it invariably has,
if the husband knows how to control himself, the
transfer is more like the transplanting of a huge
tree.</p>

<p>It all depends on the unconscious depth of the
love whether it can be transferred or not, or how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
long it may take. From this the corollary is that
the so-called love that is fickle is not worthy of the
name. Fickleness in a woman shows lack of skill
in the man. Fickleness in the man shows him to be
not a man but an autoerotically minded boy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">INSTINCTS</span></h2>

<h3 id="section42">§ 42</h3>

<p>In a consideration of the essential factors in a happy
marriage we are dealing primarily with the most
fundamental of the instincts. For all practical purposes
it is sufficient to distinguish broadly the two
main groups of instincts that are associated with
the ideas of love and of ego.</p>

<p>In popular language we are inclined to say that
whatever one does without conscious forethought
is instinctive, yet on further consideration it appears
that unplanned, impulsive acts or groups of acts
may, according to one’s bringing up, be habitual acts.
These are acquired, not innate acts, and yet as soon
as any mode of behaviour becomes habitual or automatic,
the acts constituting it, occurring without
forethought or conscious control, are as unpremeditated
as is any instinctive act. One needs, then, to
be careful not to consider as instinctive what is
merely habitual.</p>

<p>Habits, because they are imposed upon the mind
and body from without, and therefore are not innate
and original, may be more easily changed than
instincts. Yet it is quite evident that man has to
control his instincts as well as to form habits. In
spite of the greater difficulty of changing the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which gratify the instinctive desires, this change can
be made.</p>

<p>Asceticism and abstinence both prove that the
sex instincts can be given a different expression, and
that a permanent, if not always deep, mental satisfaction
can come from the formation of ascetic
habits. But the effect of these, however spectacular
it may be in the accomplishment of egoistic or social
ends, is always a bad one on the body.</p>

<p>Indeed, this bad effect on the body was even desired
by the early religious ascetics who thought that
by mortifying the flesh (making the body as dead
as possible), they could immortalize the soul or
mind; a view which modern science has shown to
be erroneous, dependent as it is on merely verbal
reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="section43">§ 43</h3>

<p>The instincts whose gratifications are sought primarily
in the physical satisfactions of food, clothing
and shelter, and secondarily in all other forms of
self-magnification, by means of which the individual
may take precedence over other individuals, such as
wealth and social position, or distinction of any kind,
are called in this book <em>egoistic-social instincts</em>.</p>

<p>The egoistic-social impulses are measured by the
so-called “intelligence tests.” They test that quality
by which a person through shrewdness and acuteness
of perception of external relations facilitates
his passing ahead of others, always considered as
his rivals. Persons with the highest intelligence are
likely to subordinate their emotions to the intellect,
and to reduce them to a gentle glow experienced
while performing complicated and long sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
mental work. Such people look down on emotional
people as being less intelligent than they.</p>

<h3 id="section44">§ 44</h3>

<p>The direct expression of the egoistic-social impulse
is the inevitable comparison made by himself between
the individual and others. He compares himself
unconsciously, if not consciously, with other men
in health, strength, wealth, position, and in every
other respect; and whether he voices these comparisons
to himself or not, he unwittingly acts in accordance
with them.</p>

<p>He compares himself with women too. It may
safely be said that while there is no possibility of
avoiding comparison with members of the same sex,
a comparison of oneself with a member of the other
sex is the one comparison that ought to be avoided,
particularly when sex relations themselves are in
question.</p>

<p>By this is meant that if a man compares his wealth
with a woman’s he can say either that she has inherited
the wealth of another man or, if she has
made it herself, which is a comparatively rare instance,
though growing less so each day, that she
has done so simply by competing with men in egoistic-social
activities. A man generally avoids this
comparison if he thinks at all.</p>

<p>Children quarrel on egoistic lines regardless of
sex. Comparisons thus begin at an age before the
erotism in the complete and synthetized state is
possible.</p>

<p>A woman, too, apparently makes a comparison
between herself and different men, notably her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
And women make the same comparisons between
themselves and other women, but, it will be
admitted, with greater emotional discomforts.</p>

<p>In all these comparisons so far mentioned the
standard of comparison is an egoistic-social one.
But in the erotic sphere not only are comparisons
logically impossible, but, where attempts at them
are made, there is a lamentable confusion of thought
consisting of a rapid shift from one sphere to
another. Thus if a man should say to himself,
“Woman is more (or less) capable of love than
men,” he would be using terms with no sense. For
he would mean that woman is more fond of being
controlled in her erotic impulses than man is. This
is a comparison without sense; because woman, with
every fibre of her being, craves to be erotically controlled,
while man has no instinctive desire whatever
to be controlled. Such a comparison would be as
senseless as comparing infinity with zero.</p>

<p>If on the other hand a man should say to himself
that woman is more (or less) capable of love than
man, he would mean that woman is more desirous
of being controlled in the erotic sphere than man is
of controlling her. As the fact is that man, innately,
is infinitely desirous of controlling and woman is endlessly
desirous of being controlled, such a comparison
would be as senseless as comparing one infinity
with another.</p>

<p>This second useless comparison may be objected
to by the people who accept a current opinion that
men are more “passionate” than women. This, they
believe, is the real cause of the double standard of
sexual morality. But all women are potentially, and
so are all men, absolutely under the dominance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the erotic motive, and the only difference between
men and women is the degree of repression of its
outward manifestation, a degree entirely dependent
on the circumstances of their upbringing.</p>

<p>If we keep clearly in mind from the outset the
inevitability of comparisons between individuals,
men or women, in the egoistic-social sphere (a sphere
consisting mainly of comparisons) and the utter
absurdity of comparisons in the erotic sphere, we
shall gain much clarity of thought and subsequently
much peace of mind.</p>

<p>Does one woman want, more than another, to be
controlled erotically? If she seems to, or says so
in clearer words or actions than does another
woman, she only happens to be more able to express
herself in this way than other women are. Does one
man more than another want to control a woman in
the erotic sphere? If so, he only happens to have
had such experiences that have given him greater
erotic insight than the other.</p>

<p>The men who admit that they find money-getting
and all that it implies more interesting than making
love are only admitting that they have allowed the
egoistic-social motives to grow stronger with them
than the erotic motives. They are not stating any
absolute truth about themselves. They are merely
saying that they do not know the truth about themselves,
and we listen to them without contradiction
for we know that, when they talk about making
love, they do not know what we mean by these
words. They think that we mean wasting time or
wasting substance in riotous living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section45">§ 45</h3>

<p>The egoistic-social impulses are always developed
in children by their environment earlier than their
erotic impulses can manifest themselves, except in a
fragmentary and unsynthetized manner.</p>

<p>This is somewhat analogous to the situation of
the plants that “time the explosions” of pollen maturity
so as to secure cross-fertilization.</p>

<p>The child has no opportunity to synthetize his
erotic impulses which become unified under the leadership
of the reproductive organs at the time of
puberty.</p>

<p>This separation of egoistic-social and erotic impulse
development may have been Nature’s way of
securing an excessive egoistic-social development,
just as she secures maximum growth of the individual
body about the time of puberty. It is obvious
that where the struggle against the forces of nature
is a keen one, as was the case ages ago before man
had begun to coöperate and really to form the basis
of social living, any development of the erotic impulse
above the bare needs of propagation would
have been impossible.</p>

<p>So it may be supposed that a high degree of development
of the egoistic-social impulse was evolved
out of the adverse conditions of the physical environment
of the prehistoric man.</p>

<p>But today the intensity of this struggle against
the forces of nature which developed the egoistic-social
instinct is far less than ever before. And the
fact that it is now comparatively so slight makes it
evident that the original need for this excessive
egoistic-social development has passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>In this development the free expression of the
erotic impulse was necessarily checked. One can see
this process of inhibition of the erotic going on in
present-day savage tribes who are still on the way
from an uncivilized to a civilized condition. The sex
activity of the individual is even in them restricted
more or less to comply with the demands of the social
unit.</p>

<p>It would seem that the expression of the erotic
impulse would be freer and freer as we approached
the ultimate goal of civilization. In uncivilized man,
love in the sense used in this book has no existence,
but sporadic instances of it appear among civilized
peoples.</p>

<p>But the ascendancy gained, in early human life
on the earth, over the erotic, by the egoistic-social
instincts is now so great, on account of the comparative
modernness of the higher type of erotic impulses,
that even yet the latter are as young seedlings of
some exotic plant in a forest of enormous trees.</p>

<p>And specifically a conscious ideal is needed on
every man’s part, to overcome the undue prevalence
of mere competition and create anew a civilization
based not solely as the present one is on the egoistic-social
instinct but on the erotic instinct.</p>

<p>Lest this be misunderstood as advocating an unlimited
number of offspring, it should be emphasized
that the modern erotic impulse is one leading toward
love expression entirely apart from the desire to
procreate.</p>

<p>How animal-like (we may for example think in
1950) it was in the year 1923 for people to consider
it wrong to go through a love episode—even
married people—except when they wished a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to be conceived! Why should the erotic experiences
in those days have been left to the roué and the
prostitute? “What could have been meant by married
love?” they will say.</p>

<p>Now that an increased sense of responsibility has
been developed in women, placed on them thoughtfully
and purposefully by men, all men are able to
find by actual experiment the women whom they
wish for mothers of their children, and women, too,
are sure beforehand, both that they want their children
and that they desire those particular men for
the fathers of their children.</p>

<h3 id="section46">§ 46</h3>

<p>The fundamental characteristic of the erotic
instinct is its recognition of the necessity of heterosexual
physical and mental companionship. This
belongs to both sexes equally, although men’s clubs,
women’s clubs and the other occasional separations
of the sexes exist—caused by the overpowering influence
of egoistic-social impulses.</p>

<p>If a man cannot see anything in a woman but a
child or a fool, he has no rational excuse for seeking
her company. He might as well have a dog’s.
Those who see no more than that are themselves
either children or fools. In such cases the real
love instinct has been so overcast with prejudice or
tradition that it cannot function as it should. Such
a man is judging women by the egoistic-social standard
and his statement means no more than that in
his experience he has met more unintelligent than
intelligent women. Or it means that he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
lacks that degree of intelligence which alone is able
to evoke the intelligent reaction in another.</p>

<p>The proper functioning of the true love instinct
is seen only in the ineluctable conviction that man
and woman are complementary, and that the union
of one man and one woman composes the real individual,
the social unit. Man alone, or woman alone,
is only demi-human.</p>

<p>Plato’s fable in the <cite>Symposium</cite>, much quoted recently,
relates how humans were supposed to be
duplex—two heads, two sets of arms and legs, a
huge double-size body. Fearing the power of such
humans, the gods cut them in two, one half of each
binary human forming a man, the other half a
woman. After that time the parts were so absorbed
in trying to unite, that the gods were no longer
worried.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the self-magnification of the
separate demi-human which seeks the magnification
of its own petty half of the real unit of existence,
the true love instinct always includes in its strivings
the gratification of the other complement of the
true social unit.</p>

<p>The egoistic-social instinct then regards the world
from a demi-human standpoint, looking for self-aggrandizement
unconsciously, inevitably. The erotic
instinct alone takes in the aspect of the world as
affecting one other person too, and their children
when they come along.</p>

<p>The love instinct seeks gratification through the
gratifications of one member of the opposite sex;
and fails to find the first except through the second.</p>

<p>It is impossible, from the viewpoint of this book,
to love more than one member of the opposite sex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at once. Men or women who think they do this
are deceiving themselves. It is impossible to call
that feeling love which has in it any reservations
whatever. Every thought, every feeling, every act
that could not be communicated to the mate, diminishes
by so much the integrity of the personality in
whom it originates and initiates an inceptive disintegration
of personality.</p>

<p>By this denial that love at first sight is a fact is
meant that either of two things is more likely than
anything else to happen in the cases where men and
women fall thus instantaneously in love with each
other and the union is continued through life, which
is indeed comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Either the pair are utterly ignorant of what true
love really implies and maintain for years a passionless
<i lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i>; or one of the pair,
realizing the emptiness of joy that marks their marital
existence, is too proud to acknowledge failure.
It is conceivable that the woman may realize how
unerotic her husband is, and feeling unable, as most
women are indeed, to change her husband’s ideas,
to supply him with the ideal he should have had
himself, naturally gives up what is essentially for
her a hopeless struggle.</p>

<p>It is also conceivable that the man, profoundly
ignorant as many men are of the erotic needs of
women, may utterly fail, in his behaviour towards
his wife, to avail himself of the inestimable privilege
he has of making himself complete man in the only
way possible for a man to do. Through his entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
married life he may suppose, in his ignorance, that
his wife is by nature cold, unsympathetic and unresponsive.
He is unlikely to find by accident the
magic key to unlock the treasure of her passion,
yet it exists, and he may, though he has fallen in
love with her at first sight and she with him, be and
remain the rest of his life blind to the possibilities
quite within his reach.</p>

<p>In either of these cases love at first sight is as
helpless as any other love. The term has no very
deep meaning except in so far as all love is love at
first sight.</p>

<p>In the majority of people true passionate love can
never be experienced at first. Therefore no marriage
is ever complete in the sense of ended, as far
as possibilities of further development are concerned,
until the death of one of the partners. If
this is the case, then, it constitutes the unanswerable
argument for indissoluble marriage, monogamy, not
only with one partner but with that partner for life,
providing, of course (an exceedingly rare combination),
that it has not been actually demonstrated that
there are real and insuperable incompatibilities. No
marriage except a life marriage can be complete any
more than a single demi-human existence can be
complete until death has rendered any further development
impossible.</p>

<p>Just as a man can never know till the end of his
life all the possibilities his life held for him, and
should endeavour in every way to develop to its
fullest every potentiality of expression of his personality,
so no pair can ever know until the end of their
joint life all the potentialities of the different ages
of married life; for each age has its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section48">§ 48</h3>

<p>Adult sexuality is not an egoistic-social expression
in any essential sense. While the gratification of
sexual desire is at first entirely selfish, starting as it
does in every individual before puberty in autoerotic
practices, it never becomes thoroughly adult until,
in the case of the man, he has secured in his mate
her perfect satisfaction on which his own depends.
He can never marry in the deepest sense if he retains
his autoerotic tendencies. A man’s satisfaction
on attaining solely his own erotic acme without
reference to that of his mate, is in every case an
autoerotic satisfaction. The woman, in this instance,
is merely an impersonal object or instrument by
means of which he produces an effect on himself.
In this respect his woman is no more personal than
his food.</p>

<p>It may be said that a man’s satisfaction is none
the less selfish, even though it be conditioned on a
woman’s. But the self-satisfaction which <em>excludes</em>
that of the woman must be greater in selfishness and
actually less human. In fact this reciprocal self-satisfaction
is the distinguishing human trait without
which the sex life of most marriages, like all prostitution,
is not other than animal heat.</p>

<p>A man frequently thinks he has to make a conscious
choice between courses of action that are predominantly
egoistic-social or erotic. He thinks of
the erotic life as taking time, and incidentally money
in the time lost alone, to pay enough attention to a
woman to develop her erotic possibilities, and many
men acting under this false impression that erotism
weakens practical accomplishment, have decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that the egoistic-social path was the more attractive.
But even they can never free themselves from the
promptings of the erotic impulse.</p>

<p>Such men, thinking erroneously that all sexual acts
are erotic, making as they do no distinction between
the two, believe that they have somehow fulfilled an
erotic need by keeping a woman, either a wife or a
mistress. This travesty of the truly erotic by a man
who acts mainly from egoistic-social motives is self-deception.
The two are not only not the same, but
never can be made so.</p>

<h3 id="section49">§ 49</h3>

<p>Many a young man making a success of his business,
paying off his debts and beginning to pile up
money, lets up a bit from the strain of business and
begins to look about him for amusement keener
than the ordinary recreations.</p>

<p>He meets an attractive young woman, puts her
down mentally as not quite up to his social scale, but
finding her responsive determines to go as far with
her as she will let him. Of course this is starting
wrongly, on the basis of not so much making her an
integral part of his own personality as trying to find
in her an objective and nearly impersonal means of
procuring autoerotic pleasure for himself. Not how
he pleases her is his ultimate thought but how she
pleases him. It has possibly not occurred to him
that he likes her because he likes the effects
she produces in him and that no matter how much
money he lavishes on her, it is barter for certain
privileges she permits him to take with her. These
privileges are not the highest and greatest he could
avail himself of, with a woman he would make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wife, the chief privilege being that of developing
himself through her and incidentally of developing
her to the highest degree of which she is capable.</p>

<p>On the contrary he does not take a great deal of
interest in any section of her personality except her
body. He may think her cute and amusing or enigmatic
if he is interested in solving puzzles; but he
is not likely to find any of her mental characteristics
engaging, although she probably has such, even if
she allows him liberties he might consider impossible
in some other women. He will probably not introduce
her to his mother or sisters, as he holds them
as a different class of women; and with the secretly
followed woman he feels on a different social plane,
no matter how personally neat and attractive she
may be. If she engages with him in any erotic preliminary
play, she ostracizes herself in his eyes from
the class of women to which his mother and sisters
belong, women who would not do that. This comes
from his youthful propensity to bisect everything
into absolutely good and absolutely bad. Women
are thus divided into the mother class (which includes
of course sisters and cousins) who are supposed
by him to be non-erotic in a sense. Chief
goddess in this class of erotically pure women is the
mother-imago or angel-imago described in another
section.</p>

<p>To the ideas, opinions, beliefs and other spiritual
and intellectual characteristics of his clandestine
“love” he pays little attention. Believing again, and
again erroneously, in the utter bisection of human
qualities, he does not know that supreme erotic
attainments demand the highest intellectual abilities,
or the utmost freedom from traditional superstitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
about conventional morals. He does not know that
his own greatest intellectual development is conditioned
on his own fullest erotic development, which
he can achieve only by the deepest and most searchingly
passionate pursuit first of the soul and second
of the body of his inamorata. His tendency toward
gross bisection makes him accept the common shallow
opinion that physical and spiritual are far as the
poles asunder. He does not know that what he
thinks the keenest physical pleasure is, as physical
pleasure, far inferior to what it might become for
him if he treated his evening love to the full illumination
of his intellect and his reason. He also
thinks and still erroneously that he can purge away
all earthly love from the woman of the mother-imago
class and find for his wife, whom he will later love
spiritually after he has satisfied his physical passions,
a woman absolutely pure of all human passion.</p>

<p>He makes the serious mistake of thinking he can
love on a sort of departmental plan, a plan that
may work well in his business or in any other egoistic-social
sphere, but in the erotic is an utter failure.</p>

<p>He thinks, in other words, that he has passions
that should be called base, and that he can gratify
these desires with one type of woman. That their
baseness is only a matter of the autoerotic mode in
which he gratifies them has perhaps never occurred
to him. Nor has he ever known that no passion
can rightly be called base if gratified allerotically,
which is the opposite of autoerotically. For allerotism
is the passionate love not of self but of another.
No one could be called in any sense unethical who
gratified his own desires only through the gratified
desires of another. But that is not the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
well-to-do young man with a clandestine “love”
affair.</p>

<p>The hardest thing for this young man to see is
the fact, which is quite patent to the unconscious
both of the young woman and of himself, the simple
fact that his interest in her is merely autoerotic.
Some indeed will say that they are fully aware that
they are keeping up secret relations with women for
purely selfish reasons. They see that, in their day
life, business is business and one has to sell and buy;
and they wrongly suppose that the selling and buying
of women’s bodies is no worse than business.
The woman gets well paid for her services. Indeed
they may, if they have read him, quote Ellis, who
contrasts the reward of the average wife and the
average <i lang="fr">demimondaine</i>, and says that the prostitute
is much better paid than the wife, and does far less
for the economic reward she gets.</p>

<p>But the young man who thinks for a moment that
there is anything really erotic in the relations between
himself and the young woman whom he disdains
to make his wife, knows no more of erotism
than a butterfly does of the depths of the ocean.
His case is simply that of an undeveloped embryo.
His autoerotic love is a wasted gonad that has never
met the cell with which alone it could completely
fuse and grow into an individual of its appropriate
species.</p>

<p>Not all sexual acts are erotic. Many are no more
truly erotic than smoking a pipe or chewing gum.
The man who for egoistic-social reasons refuses to
confine his love to a woman he has married or intends
to marry, and thereby removes all chance of
the vivifying effects of true erotism being caused in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
his extra-marital life by the depth of his marital
love, is starting in the wrong direction every time.
He has left undeveloped the truly erotic part of
himself, which, thus banished into the unconscious,
will nevertheless, through its indirect manifestations,
completely warp his sex life. He will have no
love life whatever. In spite of its frequent occurrence
in men in general, sex life without love life is
a monstrosity.</p>

<p>Erotism, then, may be defined as the highest expression
of sex, from which all autoerotic impulses
have been removed, or in which they have been so
much subordinated that they play an almost negligible
part.</p>

<h3 id="section50">§ 50</h3>

<p>In our competitive economic social structure of
yesterday and today the egoistic-social factor has
been stressed to the utmost, almost, indeed, to the
breaking point for all civilized people, quite to the
breaking point with many of them. This egoistic
tendency has evidently changed if not perverted
much of the pure love instinct. It has, for instance,
caused woman to judge man by his success in
economic competition and also to adopt for herself
a competitive modus which has spread itself over so
much of her activities as in many cases to make her
his rival in the activities in which for the time he
happens to be engaged.</p>

<p>No work that has to be done in the world is any
more peculiarly or properly the work of one sex
than that of the other. All <em>work</em>, implying as it does
<em>duty</em>, is egoistic-social. No work is erotic; and
nothing erotic should be work and so have in it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
effort that is connected with duty. Anything looking
like work that enters into the erotic sphere is
just so much egoistic-social activity. Erotism is the
play side of life. “All work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy” needs to be reworded into “all egoistic-social
strivings and no erotic living makes Everyman
(and Everywoman for that matter) an emotional
moron.”</p>

<p>Ships are not ordinarily navigated by women, but
women could probably navigate quite as well as men
if they had equal experience. Some women evidently
think they are magnifying their own ego if they
take up any occupation simply <em>because</em> it is or has
been generally known as man’s work. Yet no man
presumably seeks to magnify his ego by becoming
a chef or a maker of women’s clothing.</p>

<p>It is strange that we should continue to make
financial success an aim for all young men, when
innumerable experiences have taught us beyond a
doubt that happiness comes not from material success,
but rather material success from happiness.</p>

<p>No man can develop the egoistic sphere of his
personality to the limit of its potentiality if his erotic
sphere is rotten to the core. And it is rotten in
many men. No man can feel right toward the outside
world or any part of it if his love impulse,
the very core of his being and prime mover of all his
acts, is so overgrown with egoistic or social fears
that he cannot give expression to the most essential
part of himself.</p>

<h3 id="section51">§ 51</h3>

<p>The egoistic instinct becomes social, even before
the intelligence perceives that it may be made subservient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to the erotic instinct, quite as soon, indeed,
as rivalries, even in childhood, appear for possession
and enjoyment. After the child reaches puberty
and recognizes the egoistic-social impulse as a possible
means of furthering the gratification of erotic
desires, it becomes associated with these.</p>

<p>This extension of the egoistic-social interest
under the dominance of the erotic is more and more,
in modern times, beginning to take on a phase of
spiritual growth in distinction to merely material
aggrandizement. It is not the best, in any respect,
for a man to acquire, for the sake of his wife and
children, wealth and social or political or artistic
distinction. Indeed, many children are overburdened
with the illustrious traditions of their forebears and
are even hindered thereby in their own self-development.</p>

<p>A man married and had three children, two
daughters and then one son. By the time his son
was old enough to desire luxuries the father was
wealthy enough to provide them without stint.
In doing so, however, he made it plain that
the son was expected to follow in his footsteps in
the business. The story is common enough where
the son becomes simply a wastrel without positive
character of any kind.</p>

<p>Not so, however, in this case. The father’s
extremely positive and aggressive character produced
a different reaction in the son, who had a positiveness
of his own. Remaining absolutely unspoiled
by the luxuries by which he was surrounded, he continued
to disappoint his father by becoming what
the elder man thought the most ignominious of all—a
teacher, and soon reached the summit of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
profession as head of a department in a great
university.</p>

<p>To this career, however, the father’s great
egoistic-social success in amassing money did not in
the least contribute; rather it hindered it. The
son’s progress would have been infinitely easier without
the rigid egoistic-social atmosphere in which he
was brought up. The ill-concealed sneers of the
father prevented the son even in his youth from
developing a genial open-hearted sociability with
which he was by nature endowed, and made his
contacts with men and women unnecessarily difficult.</p>

<h3 id="section52">§ 52</h3>

<p>The parents’ happy married life, irrespective of
wealth and distinction, is the best possible heritage
for their children. The father just mentioned could
not in any sense have been called happily married.
He considered his wife an abject idiot and acted
accordingly, domineering over her to the utter extinction
of any personality she might have originally
possessed and thereby deprived the son of even as
fine a mother ideal as he might have had.</p>

<p>If to a happy married life showing itself to the
children in every incident of the home and its management
is added the best type of sex instruction,
both physiological and psychological, the parents
have done their duty, and have succeeded, as far as
any parents could, in transmitting an environment
in which the superiority of the erotic over the egoistic-social
impulses is daily recognized.</p>

<p>An exceedingly common environment is the opposite
one where any erotic impulses of the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
are not only frowned upon but are practically declared
by the parents to be either non-existent or
impossible of any form of expression.</p>

<p>Psychoanalytic treatment of various neuroses
strikes, unsuggested by the analyst, the sexual factor,
as Frink says in his <cite>Morbid Fears and Compulsions</cite>
(page 225), in the second or third interview.
Most neurotics are brought up with no legitimate
sex instruction. It needs a fair and open discussion
between parents and children, in absolutely matter-of-fact
terms, to prevent sex from becoming compressed,
if I may be permitted to use the term in this
way. Sex is forced into the focus of attention of
many children by being the only topic about which
they may not speak to their parents in confidence.
The utter exclusion of the erotic from the child’s
life is the final compressive factor which reduces
it into the smallest possible compass, into dangerously
explosive density. The exclusive emphasis on
the egoistic-social in the bosom of the family drives
out the erotic from the consciousness of children in
the only situation, where it would be more ethical
than in any other. Many children never see their
parents <i lang="la">in puris naturalibus</i>, though there is no logical
or psychological reason why they should not, and
many psychological reasons why they should have
experiences that would prevent them, boys as well
as girls, from the shock of some later chance
revelation.</p>

<p>Many children never see any endearments between
their parents, partly because when the children are
old enough consciously to notice these, they have
ceased to take place. The marriage of the parents
has run down. They are no longer lovers but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
purely egoistic-social business partners in the home.</p>

<p>But where should a tradition arise, and how be
perpetuated, of a noble type of marital love, except
in and by the children’s home? How should they
learn anything or where should they best learn of
married happiness except from their father and
mother? If they see better marital relations evidenced
in the homes of the companions they may
visit, surely they will at least unconsciously realize
that at home all is not well, and the unconscious
principle of identification will make them think that
as their parents lacked warmth of affection so they
themselves must or will.</p>

<p>Homes in which the marriage of the parents has
run down are not the best homes for children. The
parents realize this and try to act out frequently a
love which they no longer feel in their hearts. But
all acting of this character is absolutely transparent
to the unconscious of the child.</p>

<h3 id="section53">§ 53</h3>

<p>The best parental environment, the one that gives
the erotic its due, is that in which the child is allowed
to remain a child until he is required to develop
certain phases of the egoistic-social environment.
The best home environment is that in which the
parents are themselves, and particularly the father,
emotionally, i.e. erotically, adult and not, as in so
many homes, emotionally childish.</p>

<p>The emotionally childish status, in the erotic
sphere of many parents, is due at least partly to fear,
which is purely an egoistic-social emotion. Love has
in its pure state no such emotion as fear but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fears that are so commonly associated with the
expression of love are all of egoistic-social origin.</p>

<p>While love is properly identified with sex, there
being no real expression of love that is not fundamentally
a sex expression, there is every reason why
love should be freed from acquired associations with
fear; and if the fear which has, through puritanical
views, attached to sex could be removed from sex
and therefore from love, people today would be
able to live a much more fully expressed life; for the
inhibitions irrationally associated with sex have
taken away from life an inestimable amount of
health, strength and beauty.</p>

<p>The inference from this is that the only possible
time to prevent the acquirement of inhibitions is
early childhood, and the only possible people to do
it are the parents.</p>

<p>The perfect love pattern will never spontaneously
originate with the man of the world; but with his
children it may if he will, if both parents will, practically
refrain from interference. The parents know
well enough, sometimes consciously but more often
unconsciously, that their love pattern is a poor one—poor
in conception and poor in execution. It is
poor in joy and rich in misery. According to this
perverted pattern they have lived their own love,
and if they but pause to think, they will withhold
their hands and their words from interfering with
the illumination which is slowly reaching the younger
generation, but which blinds the parents’ eyes to
true life values.</p>

<p>In order to be a wholesome one, the relation
between the parent and child must involve a wholesome
relation between the two parents.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> You
cannot prevent divorce and prostitution if you do
not develop before the children’s eyes a marital

out of commission. You cannot annihilate even an

to obviate in the next generation the worst features
of this, we must recognize them intellectually and
react to them emotionally; and to be specific, in
order to remove as far as possible the chances of
divorce and prostitution in our own children, we
must show them an environment in our own families
in which the marital pattern is such that any deviation
from it must be revolting to the little boy and

<h3 id="section55">§ 55</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Instinct in Humans Generally Inadequate or
Misleading</i></p>

<p>Instinctive reactions are adequate responses only
in natural environments before civilization has set
in. The more complicated life of modern civilization
renders purely instinctive reactions more out
of date than a twenty-year-old model of an automobile.</p>

<p>Not only is mere instinct not a good guide in the
egoistic-social activities, but in the erotic life it is
almost worse than useless. This is so because
modern life is so different from the prehistoric
environment that humans are today unable to
follow erotic instinct, or even, on account of traditional
inhibitions, to get at it in its purity.</p>

<p>We live today in an environment so preponderantly
egoistic-social that the majority of motives
for any act are egoistic-social ones, and only a small
fraction of them erotic. This makes it as difficult
to follow erotic instincts as for a compass to point
north, when a magnet is lying three inches to the
east of it.</p>

<p>Instinct alone would naturally prompt a boy and
a girl to dwell long over the preliminaries to the
love episode. If left together and alone, they would
take some time to reach an erotic acme, and would
instinctively find that out last of all, as is so beautifully
described in Marlowe’s <cite>Hero and Leander</cite>,
and so delicately suggested in <cite>Paul and Virginia</cite>.</p>

<p>Not only has the social convention of the present
day tended more and more to inhibit the introduction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
prelude, first and second acts of the love drama
but it has raised such a barrier against the third act
as to give it an entirely disproportionate value in
comparison with the others.</p>

<h3 id="section56">§ 56</h3>

<p>There are three separate fusions involved in any
perfect heterosexual union: (1) the bodily fusion of
the man and the woman, (2) the fusion of their
souls each with the other and (3) the fusion of the
soul and body of each more closely together.</p>

<p>The last comes from the man on his side and the
woman on hers, each seeing the world more <i lang="la">sub
specie Amoris</i>—as manifestation of erotic passion;
but it also comes from the fact that the admission
into consciousness of the innate erotic reactions, in
spite of the opposition of environment—the legitimate
admission of these feelings—vitalizes not only
the physical body of man and woman, but also all
the multitudinous and diversified contacts of both
man and woman with people and things.</p>

<p>Instinct alone, if it were possible to follow it
unchecked, would lead to those three fusions; but the
sex instinct in men and women has been so submerged
by various forms of prohibition that even
in the married state most husbands and wives do not
know of the joy of any of these three fusions.</p>

<h3 id="section57">§ 57</h3>

<p>One type of instinctive behaviour is the almost
universal tendency to reason by analogy which frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
turns out to be a reasoning by false analogy
and by association of the contiguity type.</p>

<p>It would be quite as reasonable for a woman to
say that, because a prostitute enjoys roast beef or
lobster (or anything between), the pure wife should
feel it a sin to enjoy good food.</p>

<p>Of course there are people who think it is wrong
to enjoy anything, but while overgratification from
food or drink has a certain essential sensuality
about it and gluttony was one of the “seven deadly
sins,” there is no psychological principle according
to which intense enjoyment is rightly prohibited,
providing the consumption of food does not exceed
the necessity of the body for growth and restoration
of tissue. Up to that point the more one enjoys
one’s food the better for himself and incidentally
for everyone else. If, however, the enjoyment has
to come from an increase in the amount consumed
or the cost of it, then a quite unjustifiable element
of unsocial action surely enters.</p>

<p>One should enjoy food, and the more enjoyment
the better, provided the enjoyment does not depend
on the increase in amount or expensiveness of it.</p>

<p>Similarly there is every good reason why both
women and men should enjoy sex and regard it as
quite as necessary as food.</p>

<p>Instinctively both women and men would do so
if their sexual instincts were accessible. Those men
and women to whom their instincts are accessible do
gain their greatest comfort if not their greatest
happiness through the uninhibited expression of the
sex instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section58">§ 58</h3>

<p>If the greatest happiness in life be something
other than the emotions incident to the fusion of
man’s and woman’s beings in the love drama, then,
whatever that greatest happiness may be said to be,
it is surely conditioned on a happy marriage. Those
who think otherwise are not happily married and
they need to become so before their words can have
any authority. Those not happily married have, of
course, no means whatever of knowing at first hand
what is, or should be, implied in that term.</p>

<h3 id="section59">§ 59</h3>

<p>Instinct has taught the woman to expect strength,
physical or spiritual, or both, of the man. Let it
not be forgotten that mental and spiritual strength
is a perfect substitute for physical strength. It does
not mean that intellectual ability is the equivalent
of spiritual strength as the former may be coexistent
with an emotional undevelopment which is the same
as spiritual weakness. A man may, even a child
may, be an intellectual prodigy as a chess player or
mathematician without implying any emotional development
in the direction of normal erotism.</p>

<p>In this the sexes are different, for woman’s instinct
here guides her rightly. Biologically she is unconsciously
forced, against her will, and quite without
her knowing it to test her man continuously for some
kind of strength. For some women indeed physical
strength is all-satisfactory but in the majority of
cases of civilized woman physical strength, without
an accompanying spiritual strength, which will insure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the necessary erotic control of her by her husband,
will always leave her disappointed and discontented.</p>

<p>The qualities instinctively called for in the woman
by the man are the opposite in some respects. He
unconsciously, if not consciously, expects sweetness,
docility, compliance, adoration in his wife, all qualities
that are a necessary background and basis for
his childish and autoerotic enjoyments. It is almost
unheard of to find a man who takes pleasure in
the negativism which characterizes the child and
also many women, and in the opposition which alone,
when deftly overcome, constitutes the only proof
that he is or has been purely masculine and creative
in his positive activities in effecting a change in that
part of his environment.</p>

<p>It may be objected that this demand for compliance,
softness and accessibility in woman may not
be purely instinctive; but, if it is not, it is of such
early origin as to be undistinguishable from true
instinct. It is the common experience of every
infant to be treated with the utmost tenderness by
its mother.</p>

<h3 id="section60">§ 60</h3>

<p>When the average unreflective man meets opposition,
in any degree of strength, from his wife he
tends to reënact the mother-infant situation in his
own married life. This results in the husband’s
reproducing more or less exactly the original infantile
tantrum. Naturally he tends toward an explosive
use of force when he does not find in his wife
the qualities he has sensed in his mother. However
much he may conceal or transform the outward
manifestation of this infantile trend, the trend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
exists and is a positive factor in the situation which
contains the wife’s opposition. From this it follows
that instinct is a better guide for women than for
men.</p>

<p>Woman is in every way justified in her demand
for strength in her mate. Man is wholly unjustified
in expecting sweetness, adoration and the other
qualities except perhaps the docility implied in the
susceptibility to male control in the erotic sphere
which is undoubtedly innate in every woman. It
does not occur to him that the negativistic opposition
of woman is her means of testing his own strength,
and that he has in it the best possibility of proving
his essential masculinity. That he should totally
ignore the opposition by the sole means of suggestive
replacement of her antagonistic ideas by the
ideas which he knows are the best ones in the situation,
and that he should convince and persuade her
through his perfectly confident attitude that this
type of action on his part is exactly what she is
instinctively trying to evoke in him by her apparent
perversity, are too infrequently even glimpsed by the
man who relies on <em>his</em> instinct.</p>

<h3 id="section61">§ 61</h3>

<p>From the erotic viewpoint it makes no difference
whether a woman is well dressed or not or even tidy,
provided her ill-dressed condition does not interfere
with her physical health. A woman in rags wielding
a hoe or a rake or even a spade may be just as
radiant and have just as fine and attractive physique
as a lady in silks. It is a fallacy to suppose that
erotic attractiveness consists only in the cosmetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
art. This motive to keep herself in the pink of
visual perfection appeals only to sight, and is at
bottom more egoistic-social than erotic, however
much the woman may think she is making an erotic
impression by her appearance. The conscious appeal
to sight is frequently only an overcompensation for
her erotically unsatisfied condition.</p>

<p>As sight is only distant or vicarious <em>touch</em>, it is
evident that the visual appeal is only a substitute
touch appeal. That a woman with a homely face
may be erotically attractive then is no paradox. The
beautiful face is only the symbol of the “skin you
love to touch.” The visible symbol may be absent
and yet the kinesthetic quality be present. Furthermore
all lovers who take pleasure from the sight of
beautiful lines of the human form are only vicariating
for kinesthetic sensations. The original
sculptor is the caressing hand.</p>

<h3 id="section62">§ 62</h3>

<p>In modern human civilized life instincts in general,
even irrespective of the sex of the person in whom
they are manifested, are the worst possible guides.
The love instinct is also among the worst, simply
because its present-day vestiges are so overlaid with
restrictions and conventions that it cannot be seen
clearly. It has been so inhibited that it needs an
apologist.</p>

<p>When looking at the two broad divisions of egoistic-social
and love instincts, one has to have demonstrated
the essential superiority of the love instinct
and its far greater ability to cause happiness, health,
and, in the deepest sense, success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Over two thousand years ago Aristotle saw, and
said, that the greatest satisfaction comes from fullest
use of all one’s powers. Today we are beginning to
realize, after the study of the ductless glands, that
there is a kind of reaction in the body not mediated
by nerves, as are muscular reactions, and that we
have, in the hormones, a mode of interaction between
the parts of the body that has been as yet unnoted
by physiologist and psychologist alike, an interaction
that places marriage in the forefront as a
necessity not only for health but for the fullest
development of our latent powers.</p>

<h3 id="section63">§ 63</h3>

<p>For among the dozen or so ductless glands, which
Berman<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> has called an “interlocking directorate”
of all the human activities, is the interstitial gland
which places in circulation in the blood a hormone
that vitalizes all the secretions of all the other
glands, and which requires for its own perfect
working the concomitant and synchronous perfect
working of the homologous gland in the mate, in
the other demi-human of the complete social unit.
In other words perfect physiological health is
secured in no better way than by marrying provided
marriage is complete marriage and not merely a
“Platonic” or business relation.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is evident that as
motives for action that leads to happiness, the erotic
instincts (if we can succeed in extracting their ore
from the mine of our unconscious and refining it
from the dross of egoistic-social accretions) are infinitely
superior to the egoistic-social.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LOVE EPISODE</span></h2>

<h3 id="section64">§ 64</h3>

<p>From the earliest ages seers and poets have glorified
Love. The Bible says God is Love. Love as
the perfect erotic control of the wife by the husband
will be a strange concept to some minds that have
been accustomed to the theory that woman is the
Queen of Love, and to the ideas of men brought
up under the Madonna influence.</p>

<p>This control is indeed the opposite of the attitude
that many husbands have adopted (or in which
they have been trained) toward their wives, to
whom they act as they would toward idealized
mothers, not of their own children, but of themselves.</p>

<p>A conviction derived from intimate knowledge
of the marital relations of many people forces the
conclusion that this current attitude not only is a
false one, but is also one that gradually renders a
husband impotent to take the part which a true male
should take, in the highest type of human mating.</p>

<p>Love is the work of art of an entire lifetime.
The calf love of the adolescent, the adoration of
the betrothed and the first passionate outburst of
the honeymoon are but preludes or overtures to an
opera or drama that should continue as long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
two partners live together, and in which the husband
is the protagonist.</p>

<h3 id="section65">§ 65</h3>

<p>To denote the highest type of special scientific
student of the art of love, the term <em>erotologist</em> is
suggested in preference to the word sexologist,
which would imply the study of only the physical
side of <em>sex</em>.</p>

<p>If a modern erotologist can tell us that husbands
using toward their wives one form of behaviour are
themselves unhappy, and have too many children, or
too few, we should certainly be broad-minded
enough to admit that the chances are, we ourselves
shall be unhappy if we do the same things in the
same way.</p>

<p>If the erotologist tells us that a million husbands
have used a certain technique in their erotic lives
and have become supremely happy, and have had
just as many healthy children as they wanted and no
more, we should certainly be wise, if we could find
out what was the felicitous technique of the happy
million. If we saw their wives retaining their youth
and beauty and vivacity, and being both loving wives
and proud grandmothers at the same time, we should
not let envy of these men inspire us with hatred and
prejudice enough to say that their methods are
iniquitous, and not mentioned in the Bible; but we
should inquire exactly what these husbands did, to
keep their wives and themselves so young and
happy.</p>

<p>We should at the present day inquire mostly in
vain. A good part of the million do not themselves
know what they do that is different from the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the other millions. They just love their
wives and them alone.</p>

<p>The erotologists, however, have been quietly
studying the marital situation for some decades.
They have compared, weighed, correlated and investigated
thousands of cases. Some of the sexologists
have been unscientific and biased with
ancient superstitions. A few erotologists, notably
Havelock Ellis and Dr. Marie C. Stopes of England,
Dr. W. F. Robie of Baldwinsville, Massachusetts,
Dr. H. W. Long of Peoria, Illinois, and some
of the psychoanalysts, are scientists, ready and willing
to look at facts as they are and not as they
might wish them to be.</p>

<p>The erotologists have actually discovered definite
facts about the more intimate nature of the marital
relation. It implies the interaction, in every married
pair, of four sets of tendencies: the husband’s conscious
and his unconscious trends and the wife’s
conscious and unconscious trends. Anyone looking
only at the conscious factors is naturally puzzled
by almost all the external phenomena of marriage,
e.g., why they fell in love, what either could see in
the other, why another pair fell out, what on earth
was the matter with them.</p>

<h3 id="section66">§ 66</h3>

<p>To the observer not looking beneath the surface
with the scientific instrument of precision constituted
by the study of the unconscious, the actions of two
married people are as unaccountable as those of a
tack sliding uphill on a piece of smooth paper. The
erotologists have looked underneath and seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
magnet in the hand of another person and are not
surprised.</p>

<p>To the erotologists marriage is in no sense a
lottery, but a situation in which the causal factors
are just as clearly natural as they are either in a
twelve-cylinder automobile that runs smoothly or
in one that snorts along with a couple of cylinders
working. Anyhow a lottery is only a matter of
chance; and chance is only cause to which we either
have blinded ourselves or have not yet become
sentient.</p>

<p>The erotologist can tell us definitely that in marriage
the erotic situation should be controlled by the
husband, as the husband is in every case the cause of
the good or evil outcome of the match. Masculinity
is the unquenchable yearning to control the woman
emotionally, erotically. Femininity is the insatiable
desire to be erotically controlled.</p>

<p>Everyone will admit that for a man to be erotically
controlled by a woman does not represent the
peak of masculine attainment and that a woman’s
desire to control a man is, while common enough,
not an expression of her love instinct but of her
ego instinct by which women are just as much
motivated as are men.</p>

<p>The erotologist tells us (the main thesis of this
book) that the sole solid bond of union in marriage
is just this erotic control of the wife by the husband.
It is not complete and perfect if it does not, in all
activities strictly marital, supersede all egoistic
trends. A woman may as mother of her children,
as lady of the house, as woman of business, display
in those spheres as many expressions of egoistic-social
instinct as she has opportunity for or as circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
allow; but as wife she is due only to
constitute the controlled member of the complementary
fusion of the marital pair.</p>

<p>It is not without deep significance that the Anglo-Saxon
word from which “wife” is derived is allied
to the root WIB which means “to tremble.” It
expresses an essential psychological truth. If the
feminine element in the <em>binary</em>, as I have called the
perfect marital union, is somewhat analogous to the
surging sea on whose rocks or sand beaches it continues
to break, we see in the rocks or the strand
the solid, at least comparatively unwavering thing
to which the surges conform themselves. There
need only be a comparative steadiness on the part of
the masculine element. He may tremble, too, but
if only he tremble <em>less</em> than she, he will be the masculine
and she the feminine element.</p>

<h3 id="section67">§ 67</h3>

<p>The precipitate husband is over-precipitate only
if he is or becomes more so than his wife. There is
no norm except a comparative one. He must have
control (and yet at the right time he may relinquish
it); but at all times he must have <em>more</em> control over
himself, and incidentally over her, than she has
over his erotic reactions, or over her own.</p>

<p>A woman in perfect control of her own erotic
reactions, in the sense of control through expression
and not through repression or annihilation, probably
does not exist. But if she did she would make the
perfect prostitute. Such a woman could give any
man the deepest satisfaction of which he was
capable—until he found that she, and not he, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
controlling her erotism. But the egoistic-social
impulse operates as a repressive factor even in the
prostitute, and renders the completeness of her
positive control impossible for her; the more civilized
the community the more repressive the control.</p>

<p>A man married to any woman who is in better
control of herself than he is of himself is married
to (but not mated with) a woman who is to him a
prostitute by whatsoever proportion of control she
exercises over herself more than he does over himself
or over her. This is true both of the negative
control of repression on her part and of the positive
control of expression. For evidently if her repressive
control makes her cold to his advances she is
of the common prostitute type as far as he is concerned.
He evokes no more real response from her
than from the casual woman of the street. However
much simulated responsiveness the prostitute may
show, he knows unconsciously its unreality, and
feels proportionately disgusted. In the wife who
is cold because of environmental influences in her
youth which the husband has not removed by his
wholesome treatment of her, the objective result is
the same as in the prostitute who is unresponsive
from indifference or fear, or from the repression
referred to.</p>

<h3 id="section68">§ 68</h3>

<p>Quite as obviously if the wife shows a greater
control over the erotic situation than the husband,
a control through expression, he will be unconsciously
repelled by this unnatural factor in the
situation, no matter how much pleased he may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
consciously by the rich, warm femininity he has
discovered in her.</p>

<p>It is this positive or expressive control of the
erotic factor which gives to some women the reputation
of being designing, gives them the appearance
of being more erotic than the husband or lover, and
in some instances repels the man.</p>

<p>The possibility of greater erotic control on the
part of the woman than the man possesses should
be a provoking thought to all husbands who are
overhasty in their handling of the love episode.</p>

<p>Any husband controls his wife erotically, if he
actually does, only by means of controlling himself.
At minimum his control of himself is just enough
to secure his wife’s erotic acme preceding or at least
synchronizing with his own. That is the one and
only way by which he can attain and maintain
marital success.</p>

<h3 id="section69">§ 69</h3>

<p>The love drama is the term that applies to the
relations of one man and one woman for the time
when they devote themselves to each other. It may
be an hour or a lifetime, but the hour-long period
surely is a pitiful experience, a one-act farce, compared
with the grandeur of the lifelong relation. A
man who thinks he prefers a succession of short
periods with different women condemns himself
unnecessarily to a course of action which resembles
the career of a tea-tester. He may become a connoisseur
in various flavours but he cannot learn much
about women. He is a narrow specialist with really
no wide knowledge. Moreover such a man almost
never tests his own effect on women, but merely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
different effects of women on himself; and is therefore
merely autoerotic, merely playing with himself;
and his various instruments are virtually impersonal.</p>

<h3 id="section70">§ 70</h3>

<p>Man is instinctively embarrassed upon rousing a
woman to full passion, and finding it plays so much
greater a part in her life than in his, and that it
requires so much more attention on his part than
he feels he has time to give.</p>

<p>That may explain why some men are so easily
satisfied with a woman’s half love and shy from it
when it begins fully to develop. They run from one
woman to another, shirking the labour of drinking
because they have not the stomach to drink love to
the lees.</p>

<p>“Sippers,” they might be called, or “tea-testers.”
The tester is doomed to a sample. He not only never
consumes a full cup but never swallows a drop. He
has not the power to hold out. No man could
drink a hundred cups of different consignments of
tea. Nor can one man thoroughly experience more
than one woman. The sippers of women would be
as disconcerted as a tea-tester who should be ordered
to drink full cups of tea to report on a hundred
samples, if they were expected really to know the
women they sample. Their disconcertment would
amount to an actual impotence.</p>

<h3 id="section71">§ 71</h3>

<p>The essential unsatisfactoriness of the promiscuous
sex life is experienced poignantly by most men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
who attempt it. One wealthy man who kept numerous
mistresses, seventeen at one time, to be exact,
came to an analyst to see if he could not get some
help in unifying his life. It was not that he had
any troubles coming from any acts on the part of
the women. Most of them knew of his relations
with the others, and professed, at any rate, to be
free from jealousy. This is enough to show that
he did not love any of them.</p>

<p>Half consciously he realized that he had lost or
never learned the truly erotic art and though he
attended to the large businesses he owned, he felt
a complete dissatisfaction with his own life not
because it was sinful and criminal but because it did
not give him any real sense of accomplishment. He
was unmarried and among his large acquaintance of
marriageable young women there was one, whose
femininity, he recognized, was so rich that while,
for many reasons he would have liked to propose
marriage to her, he knew he would be unable to
control her erotism.</p>

<p>Knowing full well that he controlled the erotism
of not a single one of his seventeen mistresses, he
correctly inferred that his methods were faulty, and
sought confidential help from the analyst to bring
into full consciousness the reasons for his attempting
in the future to cultivate a true and deep love for
one woman.</p>

<p>His methods were shown to be faulty because of
the fact that his clandestine relations with the
numerous women were on a plane exclusively or too
predominantly physical. He was made to realize
that love is not love that does not include the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
personality of the lover, physical, mental and
spiritual.</p>

<h3 id="section72">§ 72</h3>

<p>The confrontation of a shallow sipper like this
with really profound femininity is a test of virility
in the highest erotic sense. The man perverted by
traditional views of masculinity, which overvalue
the physical side, and unenlightened by the modern
psychology of love is face to face with a situation
for which he is utterly unprepared.</p>

<p>A man’s so-called satisfaction, then, with the
superficial surrender of a woman up to the point
where she consents to let him try to control her
erotism is not, however, satisfaction at all but a
withdrawal from a test of virility. This primary
consent on the woman’s part is not a submission but
merely in effect a consent to examine or as it were
to make a survey of his manliness. Of this she is,
of course, entirely unconscious. If she were conscious
of it she would have one of the traits of the
promiscuous woman. But even if it is unconscious
in her it is just as operative as if it were conscious.
And the result of the test is also unconscious in the
woman, if the test shows that the man is found
wanting.</p>

<p>Her reaction to the man found wanting is as
various as is the upbringing of women, from the
immediate rejection in divorce on the grounds of
incompatibility to the lifelong slavery in which she
gradually withers.</p>

<p>Under the present inanely stupid method of
bringing up women in total ignorance of sex, and in
blindness to the truly erotic, a woman has no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
whatever of estimating a man’s erotic virility before
marriage and practically no standard of judging
him after. If she had, she might do something to
get him to learn of the existence of true mating.</p>

<p>And if she could know and could tell her husband
how he failed, she would then have a chance of
becoming happy. No really human man will choose
the greater of two evils or refuse the greater of
two good things, no matter when or how that choice
is offered to him, although to him it may be humiliating
whether first or last, to have it laid before
him by the woman.</p>

<h3 id="section73">§ 73</h3>

<p>But no whole man will be other than fired by this
consent to test. If he is cloyed by it, his being so
demonstrates his inadequacy; it proves his anesthesia,
his insensibility, his blindness to the future
possibilities of complete binary love-living.</p>

<p>To him this failure of his, this revulsion of feeling
at the precise moment when he has entered the very
lists of love, this slacker’s attitude, seems not a
desertion on his part, not a failure of his, but a
sudden loss of charm on her part. She is, upon
trial, not what he had expected and longed for. But
the failure, the loss of charm are his, not hers. He
ought to be the charmer. He ought to have been
informed that it is his privilege and power to attain
the pleasure of putting his woman into another
world of sheer exuberant joy—that his own pleasure
in life can be attained by no other means; and that
the consent of the woman to be his wife is a consent
not to take one step with him, and then have him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
vanish, but to travel the path of life-love to its end—a
path that is long and joyous, a path from which
no seeing man, no man with eyes of love, can ever
wish to depart. For with him is happiness personified
and before him and leading him on is light.</p>

<h3 id="section74">§ 74</h3>

<p>The acts and scenes and various episodes and
strophes of this lifelong drama are never more
than parts, and are organically related each to the
other and to the whole life poem. No matter what
one’s egoistic-social impulses and activities are, the
racial theme, i.e., emotional culture and development,
should be as far as possible continuous and
its phrases related. The racial theme is organic,
emotional. The narrower national, or sectional,
theme in life is the intellectual one.</p>

<p>For the so-called sexual act the term <em>love episode</em>
has been substituted in this book. Like a duet on
an operatic stage it should be just as much a combination
of the melody of the emotions of each of
the two partners, and the harmony of both of their
orchestras of emotions, as are the melody and harmony
arranged by the composer of an opera score.
The husband should be the composer.</p>

<p>It will be replied that the ordinary man is not
of the intellectual calibre of the Wagners, Gounods,
and Verdis, and that if the love life is to be so
exalted in the ordinary marriage it would be a hopeless
task, for so few men have the intellectuality to
create a work of art of such dimensions.</p>

<p>But the greatness of composers and poets consists
in their approaching so near to life with media so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
inorganic as sound and sight; and while music is
enjoyed by most people, different styles and grades
of music have the characteristic of bringing the
melody and harmony to a definite and gratifying
end. Music therefore essentially consists of the art
of producing a tension and finally a relaxation of
human emotions by means of sound.</p>

<p>Love as an art consists of the same production
of tension and relaxation in a rhythm whose first
pulsation begins even in childhood and whose last is
coincident with the final heartbeat of the individual.</p>

<h3 id="section75">§ 75</h3>

<p>Love, in the sense used above, practically includes
every action of the husband or wife in relation to
each other, from the beginning of the first act of
love-living to the end of their joint life.</p>

<p>The love episode is not a violent activity for a
brief space of five or ten minutes. In its highest
form it begins when either of the pair thinks of any
part of it. A true work of erotic art will progress
from these thoughts, through all the phases of
verbal mention, or actual carrying out of any preliminary—all
the various verbal and other endearments,
all the caresses and changing contacts, in
multitudinous variety of external circumstances. It
will progress through the purely physical part of it,
or that part which is regarded as purely physical
(but which never is, exclusively), and will continue
for an hour to a day after the erotic acme.</p>

<p>During this post-acme time all the thoughts and
emotions of each will be referred to the past episode
and not to any future one. In the interim between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the evanescence of these thought-reverberations, and
the growing tension of another approaching love
episode there may be a space of some hours or a day
or two, but, where there is a fully expressed love
life, never more than that.</p>

<h3 id="section76">§ 76</h3>

<p>There is an unmistakable sign when the union of
the two natures of a man and a woman has taken
place. It is not the procreation of children, it is
not living together only, it is not a joint bank account
or any mere superficial unity or congeniality of
external (egoistic-social) interests; but it is an emotional
reaction at a time of intimate physical communion,
a flood of feeling of an absolutely unique
character, which, once experienced, leads true lovers
to say that nothing in the world they have ever
heard of could be in any respect like it—a flood of
feeling, which, like the perigee tide, enters and fills
every nook and cranny of the being of each, just
as the waters of an estuary rise and fill and overflow
when the sun and the moon both pull together
and the wind blows into the river’s mouth.</p>

<p>And the first time that emotional flood tide is
experienced is nothing to what later psychosomatic
communion may attain. Man and wife looking
back on their honeymoon thirty years before realize
poignantly how infinitely more exalted and overwhelming
is their present-day love communion than
were the unsteady, brief and trembling, uncoördinated
embraces of their early married life. True,
they looked at each other with eyes of love long
years before, but such simple, ignorant, artless infantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eyes, that looked without seeing half there was
to see. They have learned each other as they never
could have learned any two, much less three or more,
of the other sex. Each has learned how to give, and
that riches consist only in power to give, and that
power to give is developed only by giving, just as
skill in swimming comes from swimming and not
from standing on the shore.</p>

<p>So they immerge each day into the invigorating
ocean, and glory in the rise and fall of its surf, in
its colour and in its refreshing coolness; and when
they become too old to swim, they will sit by the
open fire and exchange sweet reminiscences of bygone
plunges, until their spirits together breast the
waves of infinity and eternity forever.</p>

<h3 id="section77">§ 77</h3>

<p>One of the factors of the general marital muddle
that constitutes most marriages is the ignorance of
husband or wife, or both, about whether their sex
life, if they still continue it, is normal. What are
the evidences that the consummation of marital life
has taken place as satisfactorily as could be wished,
or as could occur with the pair in question, or (as is
supposed at any rate) takes place with the newly
married lovers on their honeymoon?</p>

<p>It is not enough merely to be able to say they are
happy, for they will sometimes say so whether they
know they are or not, and they will in some cases
not know. In fact few people in or out of the wedded
state know whether they are truly happy or not or
how to become happy if they are not so.</p>

<p>If a husband and wife are happy together they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
will have begun to make their marital life a love
drama, by the frequent enactment of the love episode
as described in these pages and their outlook upon
life will be buoyant and positive.</p>

<h3 id="section78">§ 78</h3>

<p>In <cite>The Secret Places of the Heart</cite>, H. G. Wells
has plainly indicated that the love episode has taken
place between Sir Richmond Hardy and Miss
Grammont. He writes only of the calm which
follows the emotional storm, and in these words
(p. 253):</p>

<p>“At the breakfast table it was Belinda (Miss
Grammont’s companion) who was the most nervous
of the three, the most moved, the most disposed to
throw a sacramental air over their last meal together.
Her companions had passed beyond the
idea of separation; it was as if they now cherished
a secret satisfaction at the high dignity of their
parting. Belinda in some way perceived they had
become different. They were no longer tremulous
lovers. They seemed sure of one another and with
a new pride in their bearing.”</p>

<h3 id="section79">§ 79</h3>

<p>Some husbands treat their wives with a satisfactory
erotic technique from the first, and a few
continue it through their entire married life. Others
err from the first, through ignorance, and still others
are backsliders in the pursuit of the erotic art; and
true love departs from these.</p>

<p>There have been others who by accident have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
found after years of wedded life the key to marital
happiness, or have been instructed by some erotologist—some
physician who knows or some intimate
friend.</p>

<p>The story of one husband who happened to discover
for himself a secret that had escaped him
for years is here given:</p>

<p>It was in the twentieth year of their marriage.
Their son was eighteen and their daughter sixteen.
Another daughter was not yet born.</p>

<p>They were off for a week in the month of August
in the Adirondacks. All the morning they had
tramped over the hills until they came to a lake,
solitary, shut in by forests, a mountain overtowering
the side opposite them—reflected green and blue
in the waters that met their eyes as they approached
a beach of fine white sand.</p>

<p>Sitting awhile they rejoiced in having found so
fine a place to eat their lunch. They were miles
from any human habitation. A heron floated majestically
through the air. A kingfisher hurried
noisily athwart their view. A fish jumped out of
the water a dozen rods away and made a circle
of waves which slowly enlarged until it became lost
to sight.</p>

<p>Instinctively they both threw off their clothes and
stepped down to the water’s edge hand in hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll beat you in!”</p>

<p>“Let’s swim to that little island.”</p>

<p>In they splashed and swam the first few yards
under water, he leading the way, she following, but
his eyes closely watching for any indication on her
part of fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stay near me, Matey, there’s nothing but water
where I am.”</p>

<p>“All right, Naiade, put your hand on my shoulder
and rest awhile. We’re almost there!”</p>

<p>He felt her warm hand on his shoulder and her
thumb on the back of his neck, and the warmth of
the sun on his rapidly drying hair—there in the pure
water almost arrived at the wooded islet. He felt
the impact of the water on his flank stirred by the
leisurely motions of her other hand and arm as
she made as if to help him tow her to shore.</p>

<p>They climbed up and sat on a mossy bank out of
sight of every living thing, looking from a shady
spot at the lake shimmering in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Our lunch is over there. We should have
brought it with us. Nevertheless I’ll feed upon thy
lips, Corinna.</p>

<p>“What an experience this is! I never had a swim
like this before. A perfect day and a perfect place.
Isolation complete. Thou beside me singing in the
wilderness, but this is a very Eden and we are undisputed
owners of it for this hour. I’m rich in time.
I’d just as soon stay here till sunset. An absolutely
perfect place to rest and play. I feel as if I could
do anything—omnipotent as the gods of old, dependent
on nothing. It thrills me to think of myself—just
me—and you—just you—the only humans in
all the world we see. If I were a magician I’d turn
this moss into a magic carpet and we’d fly through
space.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Matey dear, I feel as if I <em>were</em> flying! Tell
me more like that. Continue the story. Tell it
softly close in my ear.”</p>

<p>“Up, out from this islet we are flying, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
deafening roar of airplane engine, but just soaring,
soaring, wheeling in the air like eagles, you and I
together. Far subtler motion than the intermittent
strokes with which we paddled to that green islet
now so far below us. Blue sky all about and sunshine
warm upon my shoulders and your breasts.
See down below us now a cloud. See our silhouette
dotting the grey mist of it. And look, dearest!
That rainbow of which our shadow is the centre. It
makes a complete circle. Did you ever seen the
whole circle of iridescence like that? You never
could on earth. Look again, for soon we shall pass
that cloud. A perfect circle of perfect rainbow
colours—symbol of infinite beauty.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Matey, this flight of yours is too thrilling.
Take me down to earth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Matey, dear, in all our twenty years of love, I
never knew you till this day. Why did you not teach
me about you before this?”</p>

<p>They were now slowly swimming through the
placid waters of the lake toward the beach of white
sand whence they had adventurously departed two
hours before. The sun warmed their heads and
the cool waters of the lake caressed their glowing
bodies.</p>

<p>They stepped upon the sandy beach again.</p>

<p>They devoured their lunch with eagerness.</p>

<p>They now, while eating, having dried in the sun,
by force of habit put on their conventional incumbrances
of sex-differentiating toggery, took up their
staffs and turned their backs upon the lake with
its silvery waves and white sandy beach and slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
wended their way hand in hand through the forest,
to the road leading to the inn.</p>

<p>As they walked along the mountain road slipping
on stones and gravel each saw in the other’s eyes a
new flame of love never lighted there before.</p>

<p>“I wonder, Matey, what it was that made this
day’s adventure the grand adventure of my life?
I never saw you look so fine before. I never felt
closer to you than I do this minute. Why have
you never before told me a story like that, that fired
my imagination as yours seemed to be?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I never felt fired just that way myself.
Ideas occurred to me I’d never had before. Besides,
I’ve done a pile of thinking lately—and reading, too.
I think I’ve succeeded in piecing out a pretty good
fairy tale about us. It makes me much more interested
in your view of the world than ever I was
before. But I can tell you other stories now. I
think I’ve learned how to fire your imagination.”</p>

<p>“You have, indeed! I’m eager for the next.
When will it be?”</p>

<p>“Almost any time we have an hour or two alone.
We need time to get up steam, so to speak. We
don’t need to swim in a mountain lake every time
either. I think you got your particular thrill because
you had me and my mind absolutely all to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Can I ever get that again?”</p>

<p>“Surely, dear heart, for when I saw for the first
time that look in your eyes, which was not joy alone
but pure fire, I learned something about you I never
knew before. I realized that you yourself are a
far more complex and interesting personality with
infinitely more potentialities than ever I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
dreamed of. Do you think now I would ever stop
telling you stories like that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember a word of it except the perfect
rainbow circle. The rest was silence. But it had
somehow a world of meaning for me. I know we
swam. I know we couldn’t fly, but you made me
think we did, which is quite as good for me.”</p>

<h3 id="section80">§ 80</h3>

<p>“Dear, why has it taken us twenty years to love
each other as we do now?”</p>

<p>“It was our ignorance, which was so dense that
it did not know it was ignorant. That’s the blackest
kind. What we knew was that we had affection
for each other, and for our children, but the lack
of passion was not clearly sensed, because there was
no article in our creed of love that declared passion
to be a necessary factor in our marriage. We knew
the phrase ‘all in all to each other’; we identified
ourselves in countless superficial ways in addition to
the really solid identification represented in our
children, but while we did it with our intellects we
really did not do it with our hearts. We have not
been truly united, truly fused, until this day.</p>

<p>“It needn’t have taken us twenty years, or even
one year, for there are people who instinctively
soar in the same ecstatic flight in their honeymoon,
that we achieved only after twenty years of external
devotion and watchfulness. But those whose early
married life is instantly complete in total physical
and emotional fusion think everyone else is the same
as they are and they don’t know what they <em>have</em> any
more than we did not know what we did not have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
A colour-blind man in a world of people all colour-blind
would not suspect his affliction. Possibly it
wouldn’t be an affliction. He might only laugh at
the extraordinary persons who say they can see
colours in things visible, just as we now consider
people freaks who say they can see colour in
sounds.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, dear, that most people are blind
to the kind of love we see now?”</p>

<p>“I do, for the vision of the circular rainbow on
top of the cloud is something that really requires
a certain fine sensitivity that is the product of civilization,
and depends on the many factors of civilized
life. I could not, as my remote ancestors could,
carry you off your feet in a literal sense, and dominate
you by sheer physical strength, which would
have been the only earthbound flight possible with
men of that age. Civilization has transmuted physical
strength into mental, moral and spiritual strength.
And just as physical strength was sensibly evident
in every action and motion of the body, so now, in
our present state of civilization, it is obscured or
obliterated and every mental reaction to our environment
is taking its place. To some women the
strength of this mental reaction is invisible, and
even today they can love with passion only the
physically perfect man. But the majority of women
now have been educated to the point of realizing
that physical strength may be present in men whose
mental and moral development is very small and
that mental and moral strength may exist even in
the men whose physique is slight and even frail.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’re so much stronger mentally,
morally and spiritually than you were? Did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cultivate that strength consciously? Could you tell
others how to do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear one, to all three questions, and so are
you. The thing that finally touched off this day’s
passionate union was our realization, helped by the
increasing frankness forced by modern science on all
vital matters, that sex life is a part of the love life,
and that not only is sex not exclusively physical, but
it is more mental than physical. Men as ancient as
Ovid knew that love is an art, but they did not
know it as well as we do today. If it is an art, it
can be taught, it must be taught. The reason it
has not been taught is the taboo on sex. But that
is being lifted gradually and people are beginning to
realize that sexless love is as impossible as birth is
impossible without the fusion of male and female
germ cells. The ancient love manuals were all composed
by men to enable men to get greater physical
pleasure out of what they called love. The modern
idea is that man and woman together are each to
contribute an equal and complementary part to a
spiritual fusion comparable to the fusion of two
human germ cells, and that as the male cell causes
a reaction on the entirety of the female cell, so the
female cell causes a total reaction on the entirety of
the male cell. To say that either absorbs the other
is quite misleading. They stand side by side and
merely melt together, forming another different cell
which is the combination of all the properties of
the two. This idea of love implies that the two
lovers be equally frank and open in every way, concealing
nothing of their own feelings from each
other.”</p>

<p>“But, dearest, some women, I’m sure, are unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to express themselves, and others instinctively avoid
revealing their true feelings, fearing perhaps to
reveal because they may be giving away something
it might be to their advantage to keep. They think
that if they let any man, even their newly married
husband, know how much they love him, they will
cheapen themselves in their husband’s eyes, where
they desire to be valued the most.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you would love me less if you felt
you owned me less? If you did, your love has possibly
too much of ownership in it. Love is not
possession, any more than it is the inability to
possess.”</p>

<h3 id="section81">§ 81</h3>

<p>The erotic acme is the detumescence following a
tumescence which activates, in order to secure, a
repose which can exist in consciousness only by contrast
with the intense activity, vivification and vitalization
of spheres of experience otherwise remaining
without or beyond one’s ken.</p>

<p>A kiss which is ever so little retarded, a youth
laying softly his lips on those of a fair maiden, and,
for the period of a breath or two not taking them
away, feeling that not alone the lips touched hers
nor yet only his arms embraced her, is filled with a
natural response which tingles through his frame to
his very fingertips and makes soft and undulating
the sea crag on which they stand. More of her at
once would be too keen a pleasure, would make him
faintly dizzy with a joy to which he is unoriented.</p>

<p>The halo of that first kiss fades not in a day but
lingers through his sleep, recurring poignantly like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the after image of the sun caught by chance directly
in his eyes.</p>

<p>All his being is pervaded by the sweet breathlessness
of that virgin experience of a maiden’s lips, a
touch that spreads like fire through his body and
craves quenching by another kiss which but extends
the influence of the first.</p>

<p>“Our lips have met, a touch compared with which
our hand-clasp was a grinding of rocks in the mad
surging of the ocean surf.</p>

<p>“Our lips have met, a fragrance above the honeysuckle
and the roses of the hedge.</p>

<p>“Our lips have met, our breasts have asked us too,
why should not they repose on one another. Our
hands have known each other’s sides, and flanks
have questioned why they also might not have the
soft contact.</p>

<p>“Why should not all the remotest parts of us
clamor to share in this meeting of two lovers’ lips?
Each of us is whole and every part fired to yearn for
what every other part feels.</p>

<p>“I look into your eyes and see the world. All
that invites to do and feel and learn. There’s not
a drop of blood within my veins that does not hurry
on its joyous course, to tell the uttermost confines
of me, that here in you I find a counterpart, for
every region of my living self.</p>

<p>“We cannot part for hours. This sandy shore,
warm with an August sun, shall be our couch, remote
from interruption. You are mine and I am yours
for now and evermore. Not till I know you all, and
you feel me pervading all the regions of your soul,
shall we be able then to take anew the threads of
our existence in the world and weave with them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
common robe for both in which enclosed we act
toward our fellows, a single person binary in form.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“My breathing now is calm like yours; our blood
is throbbing softly in our veins, we two went through
a fire together, keen, that welded our two spirits
into one—inseparable, self-contained, at rest.</p>

<p>“Are other men and women thus close fused, each
through the other’s eyes beholding life? If not,
dear one, the only other joy, not yet by us slow
tasted, is to look and see how we can make them
also feel the deep-down inner satisfaction pierce the
very roots of their own being too, without which
we should lack companionship, and feel ourselves
unique and lonely. Thus, by throwing this same
brilliant light of life with which we have ourselves
been newly filled, about us, we can see what ne’er
before we saw back in the times when naught we
knew of this glad melting each in other’s soul here
on the sandy rock-bound ocean shore, where wave
and gravel mingle, air and sea and sun and sky; one
universal touch and penetration of each other’s
heart. Now we are whole that fragments were
before.”</p>

<h3 id="section82">§ 82</h3>

<p>The rationalistic thought may occur to some men
that a woman’s all can be taken at one love episode.
It may come from her uttering words to the effect
that she is all his. If <em>his</em> means <em>with his destructive
mark on it</em> she is utterly his, to be sure, if he has
ruined her. But by a perfect love episode one can
ruin only the egoistic-social value of this woman for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
some other man. For any other man her sexual
value would be only increased by the proper kind
of love episode.</p>

<p>But her erotic value is something that can exist
only for the man whom she loves and who loves her.
The first properly erotic love episode can never
destroy or ruin but only create, or begin the creation,
of a woman out of a gynecoid female. A true woman
according to the use of the term in this book is a
female who has become fused with a male. Then
she becomes a woman and he a man. The nature of
this fusion has been discussed elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="section83">§ 83</h3>

<p>As a woman’s all cannot be taken at one love
episode, except that “all” which is constituted by
her strictly egoistic-social property value, it follows
that in the true erotic sense, nothing is taken unless
possibly as one should chip a piece of marble from
a block out of which one was to carve a statue of
the Goddess of Love. The fragment of marble
chiselled away at the first stroke of the hammer is
no part of the statue.</p>

<h3 id="section84">§ 84</h3>

<p>The thought that the husband is getting an egoistic-socially
valuable possession by the exercise of
his rights at the first love episode is therefore quite
absurd. He is performing an act which is in the
nature of a creation, if rightly carried out, but which
is destruction if he does not himself hold his instincts
under absolute control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>That the love episode does not take away from
woman anything that makes her poorer is indicated
by the fact, noticed by Ellis and others, that woman’s
erotic nature is deeper and stronger than man’s.
For the development of this great erotic nature
it is as absolutely necessary for her to be controlled
by a man quite master of his own sex instincts, as it
is necessary for an ovum to be met by a zoösperm,
if it is going to develop any further than its ovum
condition.</p>

<p>At a single love episode, neither can the woman’s
all be taken by a man nor can her development
be completed. The first episode is only the beginning
of a development, that needs the entire excess energies
of her man for the rest of their joint lives. In
the sections on virginity it will also appear that
except in a superficial egoistic-social sense, her psychical
virginity cannot always be terminated at the
first love episode.</p>

<h3 id="section85">§ 85</h3>

<p>The thought that she has given her all to him is
worked out still further in the irrational conclusion,
which comes to some men’s minds, that there may
be nothing left for himself for a future occasion.
Therefore he will not take all this time, so as to
leave a little for next time.</p>

<p>Possibly getting all of her at one stroke may be
the root thought in Don Juanism. <i lang="la">Jus primæ noctis</i>
may have originated from the idea that the noble
lord should get all there was in the vicinity to get;
and he was exercising his right to own and get
everything in sight. The men who cool in their
affections (or whose passions cool) immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
after the possession of the persons of their love
objects may be inspired by exactly this egoistic-social
thought, that there is a possession that may be
acquired by means of one love episode, after which
the woman has no more to give.</p>

<h3 id="section86">§ 86</h3>

<p>In phantasying, in his own ecstasy, the complete
surrender of the woman (cf. <a href="#section158">§ 158</a>), a man may also
phantasy her being exhausted, dry like an eaten
orange, or, like a flower, drained of its honey by a
bee; not realizing that the beginning of a woman’s
love is only the beginning of an infinite growth,
which he alone is able to develop for himself, and
which no other man can develop for him—that, in
short, a man who deserts one woman after another
is simply showing an essentially perverted appetite.</p>

<p>What any one of these tasted and rejected women
might later be developed into, in the shape of a full-blooded
rich, warm femininity, he has not the intelligence
to conceive. Possibly the cynical roué might
say—look at the older women, are many of them
attractive? To which we should reply no, but
the reason they are not is simply that they were
not properly loved into a state of full erotic development,
in which they would have preserved the
attractiveness of youth.</p>

<h3 id="section87">§ 87</h3>

<p>The only true human love drama is one that has
an organic relation to a whole lifetime of love. To
the Don Juan type of ravisher of virgins the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
episode, as part of a life drama with unity in it, does
not exist. He satisfies himself with beginnings, with
staking out foundations for other people to build
and live in the homes constructed by their hands, not
realizing, for his imagination is poor and weak,
how soon his little stakes will be pulled up and
thrown away by the first workers on the house, even
if they do not entirely reject his plan’s outlines.</p>

<p>The only true love of a man for a woman is that
in which he studies her reactions to his own behaviour,
and cultivates that power of his, which is
the innate power residing in any whole man, to control
the entire emotional life of one woman, let her
intellectual life be what it may.</p>

<p>“Why,” the man of the world may say, “should
any man be satisfied with only one woman, when, if
he has personal attractiveness, he may find hundreds
of women ready to fall into his arms, and may drink
the love life to the dregs?” What Enobarbus said
of Cleopatra may be said of any woman, if she be
developed by a man, as she should be.</p>

<p>Woman’s infinite variety, supposed in Shakespeare’s
day to have been embodied in the arch-dispenser
of delights, Cleopatra, was a rare phenomenon;
but the modern view is that the variety is
present in every woman, just as the fourscore keys
are in every piano. In this sense, then, woman’s
infinite variety is dependent on man’s control of her
emotional reactions, no woman being full woman
unless and until she has been completely manned.</p>

<h3 id="section88">§ 88</h3>

<p>No human male, however, can completely man
more than one woman, any more than one gonad
can unite with more than one other germ cell. Complete
fusion of two cells requires the entirety of one
cell uniting with the entirety of another. This is
the type of physical and psychical immortality. The
union of two single cells contains the potentiality of
development of all the qualities inherent in both, but
in new combinations.</p>

<p>In the psychosomatic union of two individuals
there is the same possibility of infinite variety in the
physical and mental reactions, only if the union
between them is, like the fusion of the two single
cells, a complete total and exclusive union each with
the other.</p>

<p>The fact that of the thousands of egg cells produced
by one woman no two can fuse with each
other, and that of the billions of spermatozoa produced
by one man no two can fuse together, but
that any one male germ cell can completely fuse
with any one female germ cell is the prototype of a
perfect full marriage, and is the suggestion that
probably no couples need be unhappy; for happiness
is a matter of fusion, and fusion can be accomplished
by the removal of ignorance due to tradition.</p>

<h3 id="section89">§ 89</h3>

<p>The right of the wife to experience the erotic
acme at every love episode is only beginning to be
admitted. Up to the present time the husband has
generally gone on the principle of taking his wife’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
body for the fine physical catharsis he fancies it
produces in himself.</p>

<p>Taking a woman’s body, however, for the fine
emotional catharsis, without “considering too curiously”
just how it strikes the woman is manifestly,
to any thoughtful man, merely a one-sided affair.
It involves only as a negative quantity the results of
his action upon the woman, because erotically the
result is negative in her case. The most it can do
is to stir her emotions a little, leave her with more
or less ungratified desire, a tension which in the end
is most harmful to her.</p>

<p>Only a man whose mentality is below par or
undeveloped can feel himself fully satisfied with an
attempt at a purely physical love episode like this.
To his unconscious it can be but the stepping up a
step that isn’t there, a striking out at empty air.
For the exaltation (which would come from passion
reciprocated) is indelibly registered on his unconscious
as a negative quantity. It is a dent in a
surface intended by nature to be convex. In the
fully developed man all the sensibilities registering
response in the mate are present, and if they are not
given the opportunity to function, the lack of it is
definitely recorded in the unconscious. The man
has as much right biologically to a response in his
wife as the wife has a right to be sympathetically
handled.</p>

<p>In a time soon to come men will take into consciousness
and into conscious control all instinctive
actions, and all these unconscious lacks; and will so
plan their love that the absence of response will be
avoided. The woman’s right to be made to respond
will be finally acknowledged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section90">§ 90</h3>

<p>The right of woman to experience such stirring
up of unconscious depths of soul as is caused by the
erotic acme of the love episode, and the advantage
to her health and general welfare coming from such
stirring are two separate questions. Havelock Ellis
has admitted that the woman’s right to love and
all it can include is not a right in a political or even
an ethical sense, any more than the right to be
happy.</p>

<p>But for the existence of the relation of a higher
type of erotism to health of body and mind physiological
science is piling up proof every year. There
is a positive relation, a direct connection, of cause
and effect. Only the fullest use of all the faculties
makes the fullest and therefore the happiest life.</p>

<p>Response as an actual manifestation on the wife’s
part may be absent while there is a repressed
response present. In other words the desire and
gratification of it may both occur in her, but below
the level of consciousness. A previous attraction
which drew her toward her husband when he was
her lover may have been repressed by some gauche
behaviour of his. Desire, even after conscious passion
has cooled, may nevertheless remain in the unconscious.
If consciously accepted, desire is accompanied
by a perceptible physical condition of tumescence.
If not consciously accepted, either the
tumescence does not enter consciousness or it is not
in the same organs it would be in if one were consciously
entertaining desire.</p>

<p>In the absence of the proper or suitable substitute
gratification, the increase of blood supply to specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
organs gradually diminishes and the desire gradually
subsides; but there is still left a nerve tension that
is closely bound up with various ideas, images and
other predominantly mental states.</p>

<p>Sex desires may be aroused and even if not appropriately
gratified, will subside of themselves. An
automatic relaxation of all tensions regularly takes
place in children, who also are much more facile
than adults in the acceptance of substitute gratifications.</p>

<h3 id="section91">§ 91</h3>

<p>But after the sexual synthesis of puberty the desires
are not only much more insistent but much more
definite and specific. Still they can be and are repeatedly
repressed by many men and most women.
That they can be so repressed is the reason why
asceticism has been so emphasized by many religions.
The religious views of many people render uncomfortable
the actual emergence, into consciousness,
of any sexual desires whatever.</p>

<p>If the training of the individual has not been such
as to render conscious the manifestation of the sex
desire, it then does not appear as a tumescence in
the genital region, in many cases, but as a swelling
or a pain, or a hardness somewhere else, or as an
emotion of disappointment, disgust or hate. Some
deeply religious people seem to prefer these emotions,
in spite of their destructive nature, to the
constructive emotions of truly erotic love.</p>

<p>And we are impressed with the irony of fate
which condemns innocent people to accept an unwholesome
in place of a wholesome emotion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
makes some people think they are justified in telling
others what emotions they shall have.</p>

<h3 id="section92">§ 92</h3>

<p>The right of woman to experience the erotic
acme would be immediately conceded by every man,
if he could in any way get into his mind a visual
image of mangled feelings. The tortures of Tantalus,
Ixion and Sisyphus of Greek legend should
be kept in mind, and the erotically unsatisfied woman
regarded as a living, present human being, thirsty
and standing in the middle of a pool of crystal
water, which constantly recedes from her parched
lips as they bend to drink; or tied to a wheel which,
as it is rotated, makes her sick and dizzy; or with
huge effort rolling a heavy stone up a hill that has
no ending.</p>

<p>The right of a woman to satisfaction even if not
conceded by a hypothetical monster of selfishness,
her husband, might be admitted if he should be made
aware of the detriment to his own psyche received
from her condition. It is surely not an exaggeration
to say that to be in daily relations with any human
being who is so twisted and bent by unrelaxed tensions
that she can hardly be called sane, is a fate
that no man would choose unless he perversely
wished to drive himself mad. He might see his
own advantage, if not her right, an advantage which
he quite clearly recognizes in all egoistic-social
spheres. He will insist on having his material environment
as perfect as possible through his own
personal effort or supervision. He will insist on
having the plumbing, wiring and every other installation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of house, garage, shop, store and factory in the
finest possible condition; realizing that any imperfection
will reflect directly upon himself. But he
commonly does not see that the reactions of his wife
in the most intimate relations of marital life should
be made, not by mere supervision as of a physician
but by his own personal acts, absolutely perfect in
every respect, and that his chief responsibility in
life is to do this very thing, without which all his
other forms of efficiency are of negligible importance.</p>

<h3 id="section93">§ 93</h3>

<p>One’s wife is the closest part of one’s objective
ego. She is at least that. Many men are of course
careless of their own bodies and personal appearance.
They recognize, however, that the responsibility
for these is their own and no one else’s. But
their wives are above all things their complementary
bodies, and practically as much their own responsibility
as their own personal corporeal systems. A
man may conceivably think his wife has no right to
happiness but as part of himself he must see that
she is really happy. She is as important for his
welfare at least as his arms or legs, which he would
not choose to have cramped or palsied. Yet a man
with an unsatisfied wife is as personally and intimately
defective in himself as if he had a withered
hand, and he is much more responsible for the wife’s
condition than he is for that of his other members.</p>

<h3 id="section94">§ 94</h3>

<p>In the non-fecundating periods in the lives of the
lower animals they spend their energies in either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
seeking food or hibernating. We humans, after the
work of providing food and shelter is finished, have
a surplus of energy to work off. After procreating
our children we need to develop, in a sense to create,
ourselves as humans advancing above the animals,
not as humans descending to animal levels. This
development has been tried in various ways by different
men and women in different ages. Some have
given their energies to religion, to philanthropy, to
charity, to arts, to commerce. Few have seen the
importance of developing the proper human emotions.</p>

<p>At the present stage of civilization all objects of
study, except the last, have been worked over so
thoroughly that there is nothing new under the sun.
Religions have been analyzed, codified, classified;
philanthropy and charity have been endowed, institutionalized
and organized. There seems no longer
any development possible in the technique of the
various arts comparable to what was done centuries
ago. Commerce and applied science are already
elaborated into an almost incomprehensible complexity.
Human emotions, however, and <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>
love, have only just begun to be sensed as a
new field and source of human welfare.</p>

<p>It would seem a strange prophecy to make (yet
all prophecies are strange) that, inside of five hundred
years, or even fifty years, men’s excess energies
would be devoted to love-making, instead of almost
exclusively to the pursuit of egoistic-social ends. And
yet that is what the renaissance of the erotic values
of life will certainly bring about. Tarde says that
“if the ambition of power, the regal wealth of
American or European millionairism once seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
nobler, love now more and more attracts to itself
the best and highest parts of the soul, where lies
the hidden ferment of all that is greatest in science
and art, and more and more those studious and
artist souls multiply who, intent on their peaceful
activities, hold in horror the business men and the
politicians and will one day succeed in driving them
back. That surely will be the great and capital
revolution of humanity, an active psychological revolution;
the recognized preponderance of the meditative
and contemplative, the lover’s side of the
human soul, over the feverish, expansive, rapacious
and ambitious side. And then it will be understood
that one of the greatest of social problems, perhaps
the most arduous of all, has been the problem of
love.”</p>

<h3 id="section95">§ 95</h3>

<p>Let it not be thought that truly and sublimely
intense erotic occupation is a thing that weakens
men for the carrying out of great projects. The
greatest project is the successful living together of
men and nations, and this has not been approached,
being as far from us now as the nearest fixed star.
The union of man and woman into the complete
binary individual is the first and essential step toward
the formation of the social group which will
have its first perfectly successful existence when all
its individuals are binaries consisting each of a man
and a woman who have become fused into an individual.</p>

<p>Then and not until then will questions of class,
nationality and race be settled. There will probably
be no separate and mutually antagonistic nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Men will not be strong enough to create the hologamous<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
binary individual until they are emotionally
strong enough and simple enough to realize the
supremacy of erotic over egoistic-social values.</p>

<h3 id="section96">§ 96</h3>

<p>A fundamental principle of erotics is that in the
relation of husband and wife, this condition of
preparedness for the husband’s relaxation of his
erotic tension is the erotic acme of the wife herself.
This is the pattern referred to at the beginning of
the last section.</p>

<p>The emotional relaxation of the husband is, from
the biological viewpoint, essentially inept and silly
if it occurs in the presence of a woman unprepared
for it. It is ridiculous enough anywhere else than
in the woman’s <em>presence</em>; but she is not all present,
spiritually, mentally, psychically, no matter how
close physically, if she be not herself in the very
climax of erotic acme. His emotional relaxation,
occurring at any time previous to the complete alignment
of the totality of her personality solely in the
erotic direction is as inept as falling into the water
completely clothed.</p>

<p>It is as if Nature had said unambiguously to man:</p>

<p>“Your happiness depends on your own emotional
control of the emotions of your mate. She should
never know that you have lost control of your emotions.
If you do, you are a mere puling infant. It
is therefore your duty to make her lose control of
her erotic emotions.</p>

<p>“Only in case you are able to exalt her to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
altitude of supermundane excitement, have you any
right to lose control of your own emotions. You
can then let them go, give free rein to them; and
you will probably both come to at the same time,
she not knowing definitely exactly what has happened
to her, but surprised, delighted, awed, overwhelmed
at the beauty and wonder of it. She knew
that being in love was pleasant. She did not know
that the reward of being in love was a flight of
illimitable velocity through the azure empyrean beyond
the stars and back again.”</p>

<h3 id="section97">§ 97</h3>

<p>So far as the woman’s slower progress than man’s
toward the climax requires, as much time as possible
should be given to each detail of the love episode.
It will be shown in the chapter on control<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that this
time, and the opportunity for observation which it
gives, is an important factor in the essentially human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
element of male control. Only its crassest animal
form, its acutest gasp, is “brief as the lightning in
the collied night.”</p>

<p>In the love episode, at the time when contact is
deepest and most intense, one sees, if one reasons
biologically, that the time that would be chosen by
nature for the injection of spermatozoa (of the
millions of which only one is to be chosen by chance
to be united to the single ovum ordinarily developed
each month) is the time when the container which
is destined to be the seat of the future life was either
most open or most turned toward the source of the
spermatozoa.</p>

<p>As it is believed that the woman’s erotic acme is
either coincident with or associated with this change
in shape of the innermost organ, we have here a
prototype giving more rationally the pattern for
carrying out this phase of the love episode.</p>

<p>In other words the wife is to be prepared for an
emotional cataclysm on the part of the husband.
Just as the organs of any two animals have to come
together simultaneously so not only is this apposition
necessary in humans, but in them there is a psychical
apposition, a rapport of purely spiritual quality
needed in order that the real spiritual fusion may
take place.</p>

<h3 id="section98">§ 98</h3>

<p>In animals simultaneity is gained by the same
mechanism as that which arranges for cross fertilization
of some plants, i.e., the time for the impregnation
is short or instantaneous in one sex and
long in the other. In animals the female is ready
only for a short time, the male always. The female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
animal is prepared by physiological changes, the female
human by psychical development. In humans
the female is supposed by some men to be always
ready until by their ignorance and diabolical treatment
they find their women never ready. That
which occurs in an animal is a purely physiological
heat. In women it has dwindled into almost vestigial
proportions in comparison to the psychically
caused excitement. This psychic element is enough,
however (if rightly understood and managed by the
man), to make it safe to say that a woman may
always be made ready, even though by her own constitution
and upbringing she may never know it and
so not admit it. The female animal never suffers
the male’s approaches except in her estrual period.
Man has it in his power to cause in woman the
psychic analogue of the estrus at any time.</p>

<h3 id="section99">§ 99</h3>

<p>Ellis (op. cit., III, 251) remarks that the sexual
impulse tends to involve, to a greater extent in
women than in men, the higher psychic region.
Therefore sex, tending in men to be exclusively
physical, needs in them to be raised to the erotic
level of the psychical, in order to give man the
master key to the situation. Thus the rapport
(which is psychical and not physical) can be established.
The greater psychic diffusion of love instincts
in woman gives man the opportunity for a
complete dominance over her erotism as soon as he
learns to exercise it. In woman’s sexuality “lies
the earth, all Danaë to the stars,” symbolizing the
direction from which man should approach woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from a psychically more exalted position, and not
from below, like mephitic air from a cave.</p>

<p>As one cannot put a finger into a ring, unless a
ring is there, so in the love episode the husband
must be sure that his emotional power will not, like
a blow wasted in the air, fall upon a situation most
inappropriate, unreceptive and unproductive of the
end sought. A blacksmith must be sure the anvil
is in place before he takes up his hammer.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, if the relaxation of erotic tension
on the man’s part is to do the work, which it
certainly has to do, it must have a condition which
is appropriate for the most telling effect of this
work. One of the best ways in which this condition
can be produced in some women is outlined in the
following section.</p>

<h3 id="section100">§ 100</h3>

<p>A technique of the love episode has been described
and advocated under several names (Karezza, Male
Continence, Dr. Zugassent’s Discovery, etc.) which
consists in that degree of virile control whereby,
while the erotic acme may be produced in the wife,
the husband reserves his. There is no doubt whatever
that this technique is of greatest possible advantage
to the wife, if she herself reaches the acme.
Opinions differ as to its possible harm for the husband.
It was the principle which the Oneida Community
(organized in 1847 and discontinued as a
eugenic experiment in 1879) followed for the 30
years of its existence with no observable injury to
the men. It is also spontaneously discovered and
sporadically used by married couples at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
day independently of the propaganda in its favour,
conducted by a woman writer who has published the
book <cite>Karezza</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>There is also no doubt whatever that only a comparatively
few men are willing, and some fewer are
quite unable to control themselves to this degree
necessary to postpone their own erotic acme until
a future time. The ability to do this is the most
potent factor possible in producing that superiority
of virile over feminine power which forms the greatest
fusing medium between the two partners.</p>

<h3 id="section101">§ 101</h3>

<p>Indeed, it may be confidently asserted that the
accomplishment of this erotic <i lang="fr">tour de force</i> on the
part of the husband (during which he may observe
the greatest possible effect that man can have upon
woman) gives the husband a sense of exaltation
that could not be paralleled, a feeling of power that
produces in him a keenness and penetrating sense
of satisfaction that he has never before felt. After
an experience of this kind, he is fully alive, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
never was before, to the possibilities of erotic ecstasy
emanating from the preliminaries and every several
and separate phase of the love episode as responded
to by his wife.</p>

<p>This entire reconstruction of the love episode not
only throws into strong light the value of the preliminary
and intermediary phases of the love episode,
but it puts, in the husband’s mind, so much
value on the first and second acts of the play that
the actual occurrence of his own erotic acme has
then a much lessened importance.</p>

<p>If he can so transform his wife, as he sees her
transformed before his very eyes, and perceives in
every sense quality of consciousness, and if he can
thus express his love any time he wishes, his former
hurried, perfunctory and mechanical sexuality appears
to him as a dried leaf as compared to the full-blown
rose of his present triumph. He recognizes
that he has stepped from one level of existence to a
higher plane of life, and that he is human in a new
and enlarged sense.</p>

<h3 id="section102">§ 102</h3>

<p>Kisses may stale but the occasional practice of
this reserve on the husband’s part in the love episode
will never stale, but will compare to the recharging
of an exhausted battery, to the filling of a vessel
drained, to the incoming tide. It is a far greater
stimulant to happiness of all kinds than anything
else discovered by mankind.</p>

<p>That this is rare and exceedingly hard to get, and
that it involves self-control on the part of the husband
and abandonment of self-control on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the wife, makes it like one of those elements in the
erotic situation mentioned by Freud as having been
necessarily injected into it by man, whenever he
found love too easy and too free.</p>

<p>“It is easy to prove that the psychical value
of the need for love sinks, as soon as its satisfaction
is made easy. An obstruction is needed to drive the
libido upward, and where the natural obstructions
to satisfaction do not apply, men have at all times
conventionally inserted them, in order to be able
to enjoy love. This is true of individuals as well
as of nations. In times when the satisfaction of
love found no difficulties, as occasionally during the
fall of ancient civilizations, love became worthless
and life empty, and there was necessary a strong
reactionary influence to restore the indispensable
emotional values.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is hard enough for any man to hold in check
any instinct; but, when he is holding the love instinct
in check, in the face of everything including his wife
herself, unanimously calling upon him to throw away
all restraint, it becomes the most difficult, and (because
of its results, not its difficulty) the most desirable
accomplishment possible.</p>

<p>It is hard for a woman of refinement, culture and
puritanical antecedents to relax the inhibitions necessary
to be relaxed in order for her to gain her own
erotic acme. If she realizes that her husband must
have his, anyway, regardless of hers, this realization
makes her still less able to relax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section103">§ 103</h3>

<p>If on the other hand she is assured by experience
from the first that her erotic acme will be taken
care of with absolute reliability by the only person
in the world who can insure its coming, her own
inhibitions are much more likely to be overcome,
and she to become relaxed and open to him at his
approach.</p>

<p>The vital importance, therefore, to the man, of
doing everything in his power to make himself absolutely
sure, even from the very first, that the erotic
needs of his wife are amply taken care of by him,
will be clearly seen when he realizes that if he does
not do it himself, instinct (which is as strong in a
woman as it is in a man) will ceaselessly pull her
in the direction of getting these needs supplied by
some other man. If the husband has not the
strength of will to overcome his own instincts to
the minor degree of retarding, for his wife’s health,
the relaxation of his own erotic tension he will be
unable consistently to blame her.</p>

<p>Man’s historic remedy for this defect in himself—namely,
shutting up his woman behind the doors of a
harem—and the remedy that followed this, of shutting
her in behind psychic bars of repressions and inhibitions,
is the infantile method of force. Its success
has been slight. The only thing that doors and locks
confine is the body, and perhaps that was all he
wanted. And likewise the only thing that inhibitions
and bars of repression can restrain is the physical
manifestation of the sexual impulse. The instinct
itself cannot be annihilated. We know quite well
what happens to different types of people when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
expression of the sexual impulse is completely inhibited.
Man or woman is equally affected by this
suppression, but woman in general has been the
more suppressed.</p>

<h3 id="section104">§ 104</h3>

<p>It cannot be overlooked that the constant pull
exercised over every woman by her erotic instincts,
even though they be so repressed that she is utterly
unconscious of them, is more racking in the more
refined and cultivated type of woman than in the
other. Lacking the satisfaction of her erotic desires
she unconsciously seeks gratification in numerous
activities toward which this blind erotism is the
only efficient cause. And as the real need is never
met, these substitute activities never completely
satisfy.</p>

<h3 id="section105">§ 105</h3>

<p>The practice of Karezza, or the husband’s reserving
his own erotic acme, has an interesting sidelight
thrown upon it by the experiments of Steinach in
cutting the <i lang="la">vas deferens</i>. The effect of this is to stop
the external secretions of the interstitial gland. “The
result is that the seminal vesicle (either one of the
two reservoirs for the semen) and the interstitial
gland are completely cut off from one another; and
this in turn gives rise to a multiplication of the
interstitial cells, and to an increase of the hormone
produced by them.</p>

<p>“Professor Steinach has performed the operation
on men on several occasions. In some instances
these men were fairly young but physically weak;
in others the subjects were senile men. The appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of the subjects became youngish, fresh; their
bodily strength increased, the tremor of their hand
disappeared, memory and will power returned, and
the sexual power was restored.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It seems quite likely that Karezza may produce
the same results. It has too the advantage of being
removable at will. That is, the husband, in perfect
control of his erotism, can thus reduce the external
secretions of his interstitial gland himself, without
an operation, and reduce it to as low a degree as he
finds consonant with the buoyancy of his health, and
at the same time not only perfectly satisfy his wife
but give her a type and a degree of satisfaction
wholly incommensurate with the effort on his own
part necessary to accomplish the result. If for any
reason whatever it seems at any time again desirable
to produce the external secretions he can do so. But
it appears quite reasonable to suppose that the
arousal of the wife’s full erotism will under such
circumstances have the total favourable hygienic
effect upon her, and his fears about himself—namely,
that by excessive external excretions of the interstitial
gland he may be weakening himself—groundless
though they may well be, will be quite removed.</p>

<h3 id="section106">§ 106</h3>

<p>There is much discussion among physicians as to
the harm that may be done to the husband’s constitution
by the practice of Karezza. But while the
physicians and scientists are weighing the possibilities
of physical harm to the constitution of the husband
by this method of accomplishing psychically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
what surgeons do with the knife, there can be no
doubt of the extraordinary psychic advantage of
the procedure, an advantage which, considering the
well known but little used influence of the mind over
the body, may easily exceed any physical disadvantage.</p>

<p>The physical side of it is discussed by Dr.
Robie, who thinks that undesirable effects are produced
by it, if it is continued long enough to
cause any of the disadvantages he mentions. The
practice can be stopped or interrupted at any time.
The husband can control it perfectly so as to have
exactly as much external secretion as he finds he
needs for his greatest health.</p>

<p>And no matter how old he may become in years,
up to the threescore and ten, at any rate, he will
have no need to give up for any fancied advantage
to himself his love episodes with his wife.</p>

<p>Karezza then while possibly unnecessary, or
moderately undesirable for young and vigorous
men, may be a most salutary procedure for middle-aged
and older men, whereby they may preserve in
themselves the functioning of the interstitial gland,
continuing its valuable internal secretions that are
stopped by complete abstinence.</p>

<p>Describing Karezza as the husband’s reserving
his own erotic acme is not psychologically accurate.
As has been before stated the acme nevertheless
takes place, not physically through the sudden ejaculation
of the external secretions, but psychically
through the indescribable emotional exaltation on
his part following the demonstration of his control,
a control which evokes an altogether unprecedented
response from his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>He soon learns to value this response and his
own power, which enables him to evoke it, as the
greatest accomplishment of his life, one compared
with which the egoistic-social emoluments and distinctions
are as nothing, a power of control greater
than any other in the world in its good results, a
power of control which once exercised over one
person gives the possessor of the power the same
or similar influence over others.</p>

<h3 id="section107">§ 107</h3>

<p>If the husband’s concern is for his adult feeling
of exaltation and power, his greatest concern is the
complete overpowering of his wife in the realm
solely of the erotic emotions. His study of her, and
his refusal to study his own feelings, is the best
method of arousing her to the pitch of excitement
that glows almost to a point of luminosity. He
should learn by reading, and by consultation with
the best erotologists, how every effect on her is to
be produced in the management of the love episode,
failing which he is almost certain to arouse a degree
of resentment in her, which, the more repressed,
the more independently of her own control it develops,
so that it may break out even years later in
some act of anger or spite.</p>

<p>What he says, does and even thinks during the
hours of the first love episode, beginning with the
first mutual anticipatory thought or look and ending
with the last reverberating memory image of what
he has been through with her, every act, word and
thought of his own has an effect upon her total
physical and mental reactions, his mental expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
on her physical reactions quite as much as his
physical or her mental.</p>

<p>He can be absolutely confident that what she
most desires, whether she knows it or not, is to be
completely dominated by him in the sphere of erotic
action, and the amazing thing is the number of
husbands who do not seek this domination of the
erotic sphere of their wives’ life, but who seek merely
their own relaxation of tension which they could
get mechanically and autoerotically any time, if that
was all there was to it.</p>

<p>She cannot desire to dominate him. It is a
biological impossibility. She may be so twisted and
muddled in her thinking between social-egoistic ends
and erotic ends that she consciously wants to dictate
to him in everything; but if he properly master her
here, she will not continue to do so.</p>

<p>She cannot desire to dictate to him, except to
gain egoistic ends, and these are largely conscious
ones; while the true erotic aims, in every woman,
are deep in the unconscious, and need to be liberated
therefrom by her husband, for the mutual
development both of herself and of him.</p>

<h3 id="section108">§ 108</h3>

<p>A correspondent of Ellis (Vol. III, p. 210) writes
that, one cause, serving to disguise a woman’s feelings
to herself and make her seem to herself colder
than she really is, may be looked for in “the masochistic<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
tendency of women, or their desire for
subjection to the man they love. I believe no point
in the whole question is more misunderstood than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
this. Nearly every man imagines that to secure a
woman’s love and respect he must give her her own
way in small things and compel her obedience in
great ones. Every man who desires success with a
woman should exactly reverse that theory.”</p>

<p>The unsatisfactory nature of this communication
comes from the ambiguity as to small things
and great things. What are small and what great?
The answer is that the small things are those concerned
with egoistic-social impulses, the great things
are the erotic. From the truly erotic point of view
no egoistic-social impulses lead to great, valuable
or important actions. A man may defer to his
wife’s judgment in all kinds of every-day affairs,
unless this deference is unmistakably due to an
actual lack of confidence on his part, because confidence
of all kinds is based on love confidence.</p>

<p>And a man who not only defers to his wife’s
judgment in egoistic-social lines but in addition continues
to “compass her with sweet observances,”
being always chivalrously polite and attentive to
her, if he fail to control her erotically, will completely
dissatisfy her. His attentiveness will actually
annoy her. She unconsciously realizes that he
is playing the obedient little boy to her, and thus
making out of her a mother and not a wife.</p>

<p>The masochism referred to is an exaggeration.
The natural desire of the woman for erotic subjection
is not masochism in the ordinarily accepted
sense, which means the pleasure experienced by
some neurotics as a result of pain inflicted upon
them by others.</p>

<p>What Ellis’ correspondent means is that giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a woman her way in great things and compelling
her obedience in small things equally show that love
confidence without which any man’s actions will
continuously gall the wife’s unconscious. If he
yields to her in great egoistic-social issues, he shows
the same confidence in the superiority of the erotic
instincts (the love confidence par excellence) that
he shows in compelling her obedience in small things.</p>

<h3 id="section109">§ 109</h3>

<p>No egoistic-social experience, save when all the
circumstances are such as produce truly marital conditions,
ever has the same transcendent value as
when the erotic within the married state is raised
to the nth power. Not does any of life’s rewards
in the egoistic-social sphere compensate for the loss
of the erotic consummations of the binary life.</p>

<p>The married pair can be too sexual in the strictly
physical sense, they can leave undeveloped the more
complicated organism of psychic erotism—but they
cannot be too erotic in the sense in which I have
used this term, for erotism, in the sense I use it, is
psychically controlled sex, controlled not as in the
majority of cases, by repression and inhibition, but
by rational modes of expression.</p>

<h3 id="section110">§ 110</h3>

<p>Modern science shows, and clearly, why it must
be so, that man’s emotional tensions are never to
be relaxed in the presence of a woman herself
tense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>This applies in every other situation in life, as
well as in the distinctively erotic. A man’s emotional
tensions are not to be relaxed on a woman,
but on a relaxed woman.</p>

<p>In every sphere of life the mother<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is always
a relaxed woman to her son, particularly in his
childhood, but is never a relaxed woman to her
husband, except at her consummation in the erotic
episode.</p>

<p>If the husband is unwilling, or unprepared to
accept these conditions of marriage, he is marrying
a woman to be a mother to him, instead of a wife,
and he is completely deluding both himself and her.
If he is unwilling or unprepared to accept these
conditions of marriage, he needs to wait till he is
willing or he needs to be prepared.</p>

<p>This may sound, to some men, like giving entirely
and not getting anything in return. But they must
realize that getting the response they biologically
need themselves, and consciously desire, if they be
above the animal level, is a process of constructive
giving.</p>

<p>So much of their attention husbands must give
in order to get what few really get—the total response
in every fibre of their wives’ life-love. They
cannot get anything by merely taking. Things
merely taken turn to dust in their hands. What
they want to get must be lured forth from the unconscious
depths of their wives and must, to the
wife, seem uncaused, spontaneous, no matter how
much the husband knows he has practised art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section111">§ 111</h3>

<p>Much has been said not only in this book but in
others about simultaneity of the erotic acme in husband
and wife. Gallichan in his <cite>Psychology of
Marriage</cite> (p. 107), speaking of women, says: “It
should be known that the imperfect fulfillment of
the marital act, unaccompanied by the normal,
healthy gratification decreed by Nature with infinite
care, has a more or less injurious effect upon
the psychic-emotional being and may affect the
bodily functions.... The husband who does not
experience this emotion is either not the proper
spouse for his partner, or some necessary element
of reciprocal love is wanting or amiss. If there is
any human act that should be perfectly mutual, it
is this. When passion is shared alike, Nature approves
and blesses the conjunction.”</p>

<p>From that it may be inferred that the author
quoted advocates simultaneity of the erotic acme
in husband and wife.</p>

<p>But there is a much better arrangement of the
love episode than that. The husband should see
to it that in every episode the wife not only arrives
at the utmost climax of her erotic acme before he
does but that she recovers sufficiently from her
ecstasy to enable her to give thereafter conscious
attention to his. Where, as in a passionate honeymoon,
both partners lose consciousness, so to speak,
together, in every love episode, neither has the
supernal joy of witnessing the ecstatic culmination
of the other’s bliss. With autoerotic proclivities,
pardonable in the first weeks of marital life, they
close their eyes to each other, at the climax, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
they sink into their own subjective feelings, after
which they come to the conclusion that each has
loved the other to the limit.</p>

<p>But this is not the case. They have loved their
own sensations to the limit but not each other’s.
If it could be arranged that each should take turns
in “taking care” of the other so that now one and
now the other should first arrive at the climax, they
would, it might appear to the superficial thinkers,
each gain the priceless boon of seeing his or her
own ecstasy reflected in the other’s.</p>

<h3 id="section112">§ 112</h3>

<p>Nature has, on the contrary, so arranged it, as
is obvious to all who have had any true erotic
experience, that a supposition that the husband gets
his acme first and the wife second, <em>in the same love
episode</em>, is an impossible one; for man is so constituted
as generally to be unable to continue a love
episode after reaching his own erotic acme.</p>

<p>On the other hand woman is so constituted as
to be able to continue any love episode after she
has herself passed the point of her own erotic acme.</p>

<p>Therefore if the simultaneity of the ideal honeymoon,
mentally autoerotic as it is in its essential
nature, is to give place to truly allerotic marital
behaviour, this transition can take place in only
one way. It is imperative that the allerotic action
be that of the husband. The wife may legitimately
remain mentally autoerotic for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>It is a marital crime for the husband to remain
mentally autoerotic. That is what blasts most
marriages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Simultaneity, so unanimously approved by most
erotologists, is an introducing phenomenon, belonging
only to the initial stages of marital life. It
should give place as soon as possible to the principle
of successiveness.</p>

<h3 id="section113">§ 113</h3>

<p>All erotologists, on the general principle of altruism
and mutuality, sympathy and responsiveness,
have advocated simultaneity of acme, without realizing
its mental autoerotism.</p>

<p>This book unqualifiedly recommends succession
as infinitely superior to simultaneity. Only by the
arrangement of the love episode in such a way that
in every love episode the husband’s erotic acme
follows, even after the lapse of several minutes, the
wife’s, can the spiritually deleterious results of
mentally autoerotic simultaneity be avoided. Only
thus can the most inexpressible joy be experienced
by both husband and wife. Only thus can they be
said to be, erotically, perfectly mated.</p>

<p>For there is a peculiarly conscious human joy in
feeling, in at least comparative calmness, the ineffable
bliss of just one other human being, a joy
of which no lover can ever, in wildest phantasy,
dream, a joy that mere simultaneity can never give.</p>

<p>Marital success demands succession.</p>

<h3 id="section114">§ 114</h3>

<p>It may be said that it is characteristic of woman’s
motherly and unselfish nature that, in her utter surrender
to her husband lover, she is willing to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the sacrifice of giving him all and taking nothing
herself except the vicarious satisfaction of pleasing
him. That has indeed been the preachment, undoubtedly
originating with selfish males, for centuries
of repression of erotism in women.</p>

<p>But its results are only conscious and superficial.
Unconsciously, and that means with nine-tenths of
her available energy, she is unable to do this thing.
Nine-tenths of her very being, whether she is aware
of it or not, revolts at the monumental injustice
of this arrangement.</p>

<p>Women of high moral and intellectual attainments
can so coerce their unconscious erotic instincts as
to appear on the surface completely in control of
themselves. But what virile lover would wish them
so, just for the purpose of maintaining himself in
a perpetual state of mental autoerotism?</p>

<p>Succession in this order more than doubles the
joy of marital fusion, and does so by stressing the
psychical or hypersomatic factor of the episode. It
is an arrangement of the love drama that is peculiarly
human and once attained will never be abandoned.</p>

<p>It is a technique depending entirely on the husband’s
absolute control of the erotic situation. He
will have almost every factor in the total situation
against him—his own instincts and those of his
wife, which, on the principle of biological testing
carried on unconsciously by the woman will help
make this attainment difficult for him; but it is the
true test of virile marital love.</p>

<p>It will be replied by the average husband that he
simply cannot accomplish this feat, that it is against
Nature, and that physicians have told him nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
should be allowed to interfere with the speedy
attainment of his desires once he is on the path.</p>

<p>But a little reflection will show the incomparable
superiority in every way of this completely virile
technique.</p>

<p>It may be also remembered by those who know
anything about the intimate history of the Oneida
Community that a group of some 250 persons
carried on a technique successfully for thirty years
with no detrimental results to the males, a technique
which differed from this Succession Plan only in the
fact that the men, but not the women, abstained
from taking their own erotic acme entirely except
for the purpose of procreation. In this community
in which their principle of Male Continence was
raised to a religious principle there was a much
greater health than the average for the United
States at the time (1849-1879) and the nervous
disorders were far less than the average.</p>

<p>What has been done can be done, yet what is
advocated here is much easier of attainment than
what was done by the men of the Oneida Community.</p>

<h3 id="section115">§ 115</h3>

<p>To a technique like that of the Succession Plan
here suggested the unconscious of the woman cannot
fail to respond in the most favourable manner.
It is manifest that in every marriage that is truly
happy the husband must have approximated this
technique if he has not finally reached it. And by
happy is meant successful from the erotic standpoint.</p>

<p>For it is conceivable that some lives even of happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
married people may be marred by certain egoistic-social
reverses. There may be not as much
money as would make them more comfortable, and
either one of the pair may have bereavements, or
they both may lose a child. But none of these will
touch closely the erotic life they live in common.</p>

<p>By happy marriage is meant one in which the
partners never have a really serious temptation to
depart from the monogamic ideal. If thoroughly
fused, neither will have the slightest temptation, for
each will fill every erotic need of the other and
will continue to do so.</p>

<p>If men were universally taught this Succession
Plan, there would be no dissatisfied wives; nor
would any man be attracted away from his own
life partner. For beauty of face and grace of
form, brightness of intellect and brilliance of egoistic-social
attainment are as nothing compared with
the sense of power and triumph shared alike by
both partners where the husband controls the
erotism of the wife according to this method.</p>

<p>If men universally used this method there would
be no possibility of prostitution or any other form
of infidelity, for no man, even following the lead
of his own unconscious, would find anything better
than perfection, and every man would find, because
he had himself developed, perfection in his wife.</p>

<p>Let, then, every man who thinks himself incapable
of this degree of control over his own erotic emotions
admit to himself that he is as yet undeveloped.
He is still in the class of autoerotic infants.</p>

<p>Let him not infer, therefore, that because he is
mentally autoerotic, he has become so because of
past physical, autoerotic habits. Those who, uninstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
by erotologists who know the facts, have
lost their love confidence by brooding in secret
over the fancied injury they have done themselves
in their youth by physical autoerotism—such men
can gain a mastery over themselves when married,
and can become perfect examples of erotic self-control.</p>

<h3 id="section116">§ 116</h3>

<p>There is no question whatever of the ability of
most men to attain the degree of control necessary
to practise Karezza, or the Succession Plan advocated
in this book.</p>

<p>The only question is the amount of clear thinking
a man may be willing to do concerning himself, to
realize whether he should remain in the infant class
of autoerotics, or should represent to himself in
vivid colours the advantages of ascending into a
truly allerotic adult level of control. It is certain
that if a man realizes the advantage, not only to
himself but to his wife and to everyone else in his
own milieu, he will make the outline of it so clear
in his mind that all his unconscious energy will
assist him in the attainment of it as an objective
reality.</p>

<p>This ideal is here called a representation, or an
imagination on the principle adopted by the autosuggestionists
that “where the will and the imagination
come into conflict, the imagination always wins”—Coué’s
<cite>Law of Reversed Effort</cite>. Therefore the
natural and obvious expression was avoided above.
It might have been said that when a man realizes
the advantages of the Succession Plan in the love
episode, he will exert every effort of which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
capable to attain it. But for this form of statement
was expressly substituted the form “he will
make the outline of it so clear in his own mind.”</p>

<p>For what autosuggestion has so convincingly
shown is that the unconscious imagination of the
<em>opposite</em> of what one says or thinks consciously is
the result that may possibly follow unless he is
forewarned. If a man say to himself a hundred
times a day, “I will control myself,” he may yet
have in his unconscious a clear picture of lack of
control, of hasty abandon, and <em>it is that picture
which forms the pattern of his acts as they are
carried out</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section117">§ 117</h3>

<p>The question will at once be asked: first, how
one can tell whether one’s unconscious imagination,
which controls one’s acts and one’s physiological
reactions, contains the picture of control or of lack
of control, and, second, how one can change the
lineaments of this pattern.</p>

<p>The first question is answered by saying that if a
man show lack of erotic control it is proved that
his unconscious imagination is thus, and not otherwise,
patterned.</p>

<p>The second question requires a longer consideration.</p>

<p>If the unconscious is to be controlled at all, it
can be controlled by conscious thinking only by
means of substituting one pattern of action for
another.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the unconscious mental processes
that govern digestion, circulation, excretion, and
the work of the glands of internal secretion, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
be pictured at all in conscious terms, i.e., in visual
or auditory or other images. No anatomist, histologist,
or physiologist has a definite enough mental
picture of what actually does take place in the
blood stream upon the injection of the secretions
of the various endocrine glands. Therefore the
autosuggestionists give the most generic formula
possible—simply: “Every day in every way I’m
getting better and better.”</p>

<p>But in the conduct of the love episode this extremely
generic formula is not sufficient. So we
come to a more specific answer to our question as
to how the unconscious can be controlled. It is
controlled by impressing on it patterns of action
from the conscious. There is no other way. The
extraordinary and freakish accomplishments of
Hindu fakirs are made possible by their picturing
in their conscious minds the possibility of their
living successfully through their months of awkward
postures. If these feats were attempted by
Occidentals the results would be fevers, congestions,
and all manner of ills suggested to them by their
environment.</p>

<h3 id="section118">§ 118</h3>

<p>The Succession Plan of the love episode is, however,
no freakish Hindu proposition. But it is a
perfectly possible pattern which involves the application
of psychical (hypersomatic) imagination to
a course of action that in animals is entirely physical
and in humans takes on more and more the psychical
characteristics, as men gain more and more
insight into the influence of the hypersomatic over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the hyposomatic portions of the mind-body combination.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible in this book, however,
to be more specific than to recommend that the man
having become fully cognizant of the fact that other
men have done, and are today doing, what is not
generally done, should say to himself, “I will retard
here, I will observe there, I will not hurry or allow
myself to be hurried but will take everything as it
comes and reap the full measure of satisfaction
before advancing a single step farther, knowing full
well that whatever acceleration is urged will only
defeat its own purpose.”</p>

<p>Each man should fill out the details of this pattern
which in a book cannot be any more specific;
but above all he should know that he can acquire
control over his own passions—indeed, that he must,
in order to be able to give them the fullest play
later, and that their fullest play is not an iota less
than they should have for the health and happiness
of himself and his life partner.</p>

<h3 id="section119">§ 119</h3>

<p>The fetishism of the single sense quality is an
important consideration here. Harvey O’Higgins
in <cite>The Secret Springs</cite> shows how even a part of the
person or a phase of the woman’s personality may
take on an overplus of emotional tension in the
mind of the man, such as to make him think he has
found the paragon of all the virtues in the first
woman he sees having this peculiarity.</p>

<p>If his mother’s hands were especially beautiful, it
is likely that beauty of hands will play a big part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in his unconscious selection of a life partner, and
that homely hands will repel him in a girl otherwise
eminently fitted to be his mate.</p>

<p>The deep emotions experienced by a little boy
in seeing his mother in evening dress in the ruddy
glow of a red lampshade in the drawing-room gave
him a depth of response to that one vision that
made him twenty years later fall suddenly in love
with a girl whom he saw illuminated by the red hall
light in her father’s house.</p>

<p>One is partly, but only partly, conscious of one’s
fetishes. No man except the most self-conscious
student of his own mental reactions can tell exactly
why he likes or dislikes <em>anything</em>. He can give many
reasons; but the real <em>cause</em> lies in the unconscious
memory he has forgotten—a memory of some
pleasurable emotion of exceeding depth that has
occurred possibly a quarter of a century before.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the real <em>cause</em> of the disproportionate
emphasis on certain features, mannerisms,
or mental or physical habits of his wife,
the fact remains. It may well be questioned that
any such overemphasis on the <em>way</em> she speaks or
smiles, or on some peculiar catch in the breath,
<em>should</em> make him lose control of himself, but it does.
It is not necessarily that he is set to go off in
ecstasies at the occurrence of any of these factors,
as much as that through his own experience he sets
himself thus in a sort of lock combination.</p>

<h3 id="section120">§ 120</h3>

<p>In reality this setting is something that should
take place during and not before marriage, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
must take place at all in a man. It were much
better if it took place not at all in the husband but
in the wife.</p>

<p>This overvaluation of a smile, a dimple, a look, a
timbre of the voice, a perfume or froufrou, is used
by men even before marriage as a sexual stimulus
when in reality none is needed.</p>

<p>The question of most vital importance is not so
much, however, the shape of eyebrow, the laughter
rhythm, or other mannerism or characteristic of a
woman that causes a man to decide that he wants
to marry her, for that is in most cases in the unconscious,
and therefore actually inaccessible to him
except through much more study than he is
able or willing to give it. The fetishes made by the
unconscious, kept in the unconscious, and causing
selection on the man’s part are as nothing in importance
to the fetishes that he had innately or has
acquired that give overvaluation for him to certain
phases of the love episode itself.</p>

<p>It is likely that in highly sensitive and intellectual
men some ordinarily unobserved or half-consciously
noted phases of action or being are major causes
in the man’s premature arrival at the automatic
and uncontrollable part of his own action in the
love episode. As an illustration might be mentioned
the undue prominence taken in an episode
by the bodily fragrance (natural, not the result of
artificial perfume) noticed and especially dilated
upon verbally by one husband, who thereupon completely
lost control of himself at an early stage and
was unable to gain the allerotic result of his wife’s
(prior) erotic acme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section121">§ 121</h3>

<p>As is repeatedly stated in this book, there are
other types of reaction on the woman’s part that
are unconscious attempts to test his control, and
continually used by her. Unconsciously she gains
her deepest satisfaction, one that permeates every
thought and action of hers until the next subsequent
love episode, from her <em>inability</em> to make her
husband lose control of himself.</p>

<p>Fundamentally this is the main cause of woman’s
mystery to ordinary man. She is continually springing
surprises on him to throw him off his rigid
course of action. Continually she is deeply disappointed
if she succeeds in doing this. Could anything
seem more perverse and contradictory? Is
anything really simpler and more straightforward
than man’s imperative necessity to pursue his own
course quite uninfluenced by her unconsciously motivated
actions?</p>

<p>She will beseech him to hurry through the episode,
not knowing herself, sometimes, that it is the
last thing she really wants or needs. An allegory
will serve as an illustration.</p>

<h3 id="section122">§ 122</h3>

<p>They are ardent mountaineers. They are ascending
Mt. Chocorua in New Hampshire. She is afraid
herself to go ahead over the rough mountain trail
and see the new views as they develop. She needs
also his assistance, his hand, to help her over rocks
and fallen tree trunks and up steep ascents. She
says to him: “You go ahead and I’ll follow. Rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
up quickly and tell me what you see.” If he does
so, he runs till he is out of breath and then attempts
from a cliff he has reached to shout to her, to tell
her how to get up to him, to describe the valley
of the Swift River of which he has just caught a
glimpse. But he is panting so hard he cannot articulate.
Why should he have run ahead of her?
Indeed he should not have.</p>

<p>It would have been much wiser for him to reply
to her invitation to anticipate her: “Why, dearest,
I see you are tired. Of course no woman can keep
pace with a strong healthy man up these slopes.
Let’s sit down and rest a bit.” He would then sit
with her on a mossy stone or tree trunk, or take
her on his lap, and point out the beauties of the
place they were in, and absolutely refuse to leave
her. He really does not wish to see the panorama
from the peak first, before she does. He is very
foolish to believe her when she says she wishes
not to see it herself but to hear about it. She may
be, consciously, perfectly sincere and really think
she doesn’t care about going clear to the top with
him <em>this</em> time.</p>

<p>These two are ardent mountain climbers; but
there are many couples where the woman has not
ever climbed to the top of a mountain who sends
her husband on alone; and, poor thing, he goes, not
realizing how much better the view is when two
are looking at it.</p>

<h3 id="section123">§ 123</h3>

<p>But any two ardent mountain climbers are practically
certain to arrive at the top, whether they
get there together or the man goes ahead and waits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
for his lady to come up herself—with the help of
another man. For the mountain of which I speak
has the peculiarity that no woman can climb alone
to the top, as the path is extremely narrow, precipitous
and dangerous. If her husband leaves her as
they approach the peak (which is an enormous hill
of rock capped by one huge boulder), she will be
forced to wait until he feels energetic enough to
descend a couple of hundred feet or so and help her
up. Or if, enchanted himself by the glorious view—miles
and miles of rolling country, numerous
lakes and the silver ribbon of the Atlantic Ocean
nearly eighty miles away—he is absorbed in his own
sensations of grandeur, and forgets his wife down
there below him as so many men do, it is just possible
that another more unselfish and less uncontrolled
man will give her his hand and help her
to the top, slowly and courteously as behooves a
man to do in spite of her effusive protestations to
him to leave her and see the sunrise himself from
the mountain top.</p>

<p>How will the husband of this woman feel, if,
standing and facing the east, he suddenly realizes
that there appears his own wife over the edge of
the boulder, lifted by the strength of another man?</p>

<p>Had he known the true etiquette of mountain
climbing among true married lovers, he would have
waited until both had covered together the entire
ascent up to the base of the boulder, six feet high
and twenty in diameter; and then, making a foot
rest for her with his two hands, he would have
assisted her to get on this pinnacle herself first,
before he did.</p>

<p>Then he would have watched her face for full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
five minutes in its varying lights as she turned about
in ecstasy at the sublime panorama, the sunlight
falling on her cheeks with their heightened colour
from her climb, the wind blowing a lock of hair
across her temple. He would have enjoyed for a
while her outcry of delight as she saw and recognized
the miniature presentment of now a familiar
village, now a lake, before he jumped up beside
her, clasped her in his arms and both turned about
from north to east to south to west together, and
together drank in the vitalizing air. He would be
infinitely better able to tell her what to look at,
than he was able when he was on the boulder and
she two hundred feet below, to shout to her that
he could see a hundred miles in every direction.</p>

<p>And now he need not shout. He can whisper in
her ears, between kisses on every part of her head
and neck, the joy of both of them, and can listen
to her murmuring endearments she never otherwise
would have thought of uttering.</p>

<h3 id="section124">§ 124</h3>

<p>This climax-capping boulder on the peak of Mt.
Chocorua in New Hampshire has on its southeast
side the six-foot sheer perpendicular up which he
helped her first. On its northwest side it has a
slope of some forty degrees up which they might
have scrambled hand in hand and reached the utmost
altitude simultaneously. But she will be much
better pleased and admire his restraint forever, if
he not only keeps her ahead of him all the long
trail up the mountain but finally lifts her up ahead
of him, up the steep side at the southeast and (with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her pardonable childish satisfaction, which well becomes
her but ill becomes him) lets her, on this
mountain-climbing experience, be his superior in
this one little thing for these brief five minutes.
During this time she will recover a bit from the
sublimity of her position, will regain her breath,
and will be able to turn her attention from the
wonders of the mountain view, so that she too may
have the pleasure of watching <em>his</em> face and covering
it with kisses when he has made his final upspringing
to the highest physical altitude in the region.
Ardent mountain climbers like this will not be satisfied
until they have symbolically, so to speak,
climbed Mt. Everest in the Himalayas. And these
ascents, each with the other, will preclude their
taking any interest in the company of other mountain
climbers. No woman will want other company
than that of her husband, no man will be able to
find a more attractive companion than his wife.</p>

<h3 id="section125">§ 125</h3>

<p>For, on the mountain top, thoughts come to each—thoughts
that can occur in <em>no other</em> situation.
The difficulties encountered and overcome make
them inseparable soul mates. The refusal of her
husband to leave her and go up without her endears
him more to her than presents of many jewels.
It shows her he has the only strength a woman
can respect, the strength to reserve his strength and
to use it for and with her, a strength which all
unconsciously she must test at every step of the
ascent. If this strength is found wanting, she will
be left forlorn, the most wretched of living things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
far more miserable than any female animal. If it
is found present, it will make her the happiest of
mortals, happy beyond words in her defeat in the
contest of strength, yearning to make him the father
of her children.</p>

<p>To both of them come deep thoughts, those of
the one reflected in the multitudinous facets of the
personality of the other, thoughts deep into the past,
thoughts looking far into the future, thoughts
corresponding in depth to the vastness of the prospects
before them as they turn now east, now south.
A realization of the greatness of the world will
come to them, of the minute littleness of lonely
atoms of humanity, a realization that this aspect of
nature alone is the one view of life that enables
each to know the other deeply and to be a complete
unity instead of solitary demi-humans each longing
for an unseen other.</p>

<h3 id="section126">§ 126</h3>

<p>To revert to the concept of fetishism one may
use the mountain-climbing symbolism of the love
episode and say that almost anything on the ascent
may be used as, and become habitual as, a fetish
capable of causing the husband to leave his wife
on the trail and hurry forward to the peak that has
a thousand ecstatic views.</p>

<p>She may use any of a number of suggestive arguments
or mannerisms or actions to convince him
if she can that it is his duty to leave her, no matter
how harmful may be his abandoning her for his
own erotic abandon.</p>

<p>She may tell him that he must get there so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
not to miss the setting (or rising) sun, or a rainbow,
or a nuance of cloud forms, obscured from
where they are, halfway up the trail.</p>

<p>Of course, he too, unless he has been convinced
of the childishness of his act, may think there is
some reason why he cannot or should not wait for
her, halfway, three-quarters, nine-tenths, perhaps,
of the way up. At the very boulder he may be
persuaded to take this last jump alone, and indeed
it were a pity if, having brought her so far, he
should leave her, walled by the boulder from at
least half the complete view. Some women would
petulantly begin the descent, forever unknowing
what was the husband’s experience in looking over
the half of the circumference of horizon impossible
for the wife to see.</p>

<h3 id="section127">§ 127</h3>

<p>The <em>one</em> injunction necessary for the too enthusiastically
climbing husband is: There is plenty
of time. Sit on this mossy bank. Help your wife
over every stone and stick in the path. Tell her
of the grandeur of the view. There is no hurry
provided you both arrive at the top and she take
the final step before you. No aspect of sun, sky,
clouds, forest or lake but is absolutely different after
every ascent and superlatively, nay ecstatically, sublime.
This is not the only chance you will have to
climb Chocorua. Mountain climbing, if not too
speedy, is good for the heart, and no expedition so
fortifies one for work among the world of men as
this pedestrian ascent into the sky. Only you should
go together and be together all the time. The men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
who leave their wives on the piazzas of the hotels
in the valley are purely autoerotic boys. No man
can tell in words this mountain-climbing experience.</p>

<p>There may be women who think this mountain
climbing immoral, coarse, too rough for their fine
constitution. These will have to be tenderly lifted
up each step of the way but when once at the top
will be enthusiastic converts, for they will have in
the panorama an experience they will then recognize
as totally different and distinctively human.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">CONTROL</span></h2>

<h3 id="section128">§ 128</h3>

<p>Evolution has produced in man a being in whom
the erotic has now a greater significance than the
egoistic-social impulse. In the development of plant
and animal forms, science recognizes certain new
productions that differ from the norm of the species
in which they appear, in such a way that they were
at first called freaks or mutations. But as they
breed true to their form, they are necessarily regarded
not as freaks (<i lang="la">lusus naturæ</i>), but as well
established varieties.</p>

<p>The establishment of the erotic as a norm in
humans has the further implication that here we
have a phenomenon existent nowhere else in life,
namely the non-procreative or social love episode.</p>

<p>Indeed it may be that love itself, as distinguished
from sensual desire, is a mutation on the psychical
level, a form not recognized in any description of
natural phenomena until late in man’s evolution—the
love that comprises both physical and spiritual
reaction for the man, and both physical and spiritual
counter-reaction from the woman. Without this interaction
man cannot be said truly to love.</p>

<p>For the man of today, who has succeeded in
placing the erotic above the egoistic-social impulse,
has achieved a height that few, if any, have attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
before him, has gained a joy and fullness of living
compared with which the so-called happiness of successful
marriage according to former standards is
but foredawn to noon-day.</p>

<p>The existence of this higher type of erotic control
leading to the establishment of the non-procreative
or social love episode, brings into clearest relief the
distinction between control as repression and control
as expression.</p>

<p>Control as expression is analogous to driving a
horse and getting somewhere, control as repression
is like unharnessing him and letting him run away.
Control of the erotic instinct by repressing is not
like shooting the horse, because repression never
annihilates an impulse but only removes it from
conscious control.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind this difference between control
by repression, which is only apparent, not real,
annihilation, only removal from consciousness and
not destruction of the impulse, we shall more easily
note the necessary connection between self-control
and individuality, i.e., personality.</p>

<p>His individuality is just what he makes up his
mind, and exercises his utmost imagination, to <em>do</em>.
His work is his own, only in so far as he controls
his actions in doing it, so that they are better than
the external demand. If he is an office boy and told
to put stamps on envelopes, he can do it and only
it, or he can put them on so quickly or so straight
that the quickness or straightness is immediately
seen as his particular part of the performance.</p>

<p>He can control the actions of his work and his
play; but, except indirectly, he cannot control his
digestion, respiration, blood pressure or circulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
He has to eat more digestible food, or to take more
exercise, or to cultivate pressure-raising emotions,
or those that lower the blood pressure.</p>

<p>He has been taught to believe that his physical
constitution and his instincts are tendencies inherited
from his ancestors and that he cannot control
them. If his instincts or inherited disposition make
him lose his temper so that he is not himself, he
is supposed not to be responsible for all he does.</p>

<p>But is he freed from responsibility because he is
temporarily governed by his instincts, or is he
steered by his instincts only when and because he
throws away responsibility? Is it impulsive, instinctive
action that excuses him, or is it excuses
that are wanted by him, which makes him call his
action, or the part of it he wants to be excused for,
instinctive?</p>

<p>Is not his only reason for calling some actions
instinctive or impulsive the fact that he does not
want to be held responsible for them? What he
cannot control is not his fault. Therefore, what he
does not want to be blamed for he says is not under
his control. Any thing, person or mysterious power
can be made the scapegoat for his misdeed. Much
more likely is he to blame other things, persons or
powers for what he does contrary to what he thinks
people want him to do, than to account for some
praiseworthy action by saying it was the result of
some power other than himself.</p>

<p>If his marriage has turned out unhappily he consoles
himself by saying all marriage is a lottery.
If it turns out well he pats himself on the back and
says, in actions though not in so many words:
“See what a fine match I have made!” But why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
should he take only praise and put blame on some
mysterious power—luck, or providence or what not?</p>

<h3 id="section129">§ 129</h3>

<p>His sexual instinct is most likely to be assigned
to some mysterious power. But it is no more mysterious
than his heartbeat and no more miraculous
than the growth of his beard or finger nail. In
spite of the fact that he has not given them much
thought, his sex instincts are as much a part of him
as any tissue of his body.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the praise or blame
attached by others to the acts which his sexual instincts
prompt him to do. If he kiss a strange girl
in an environment where strange girls are kissed
by everyone, his act is not blamed. So it is his
own act and not inspired by some unholy power
(unless indeed he has to explain to someone how
he happened to be in that environment, or he would
have to blame that on his instinct).</p>

<p>If his amativeness shows itself in any place where
that form of self-expression is frowned upon, he
will be mentally preparing excuses, even if he does
not have to use them, and he will simply say he was
forced by his irresistible impulse to do that very
thing.</p>

<p>If his environment consisted at the time of one
woman whose unconscious passion was already directed
toward him, she might call upon him for an
explanation which of course she wouldn’t really care
about, but any sort of explanation logical or not
would suffice, because the demand was only conventional.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>He takes the praise for what is conventionally
praised in his actions. He shifts the blame to anything
not himself. Also he takes the praise, if any
is accorded, to anything that has cost him much
effort. He leaves, or dodges, the blame. So the
two ideas according to which he reacts to praise or
blame are the idea of whether the actions praised
or blamed are his, the result of his conscious effort,
and the idea of whether or not the actions or their
results are pleasant.</p>

<h3 id="section130">§ 130</h3>

<p>On this principle he does always the next best
thing to what he thinks is expected of him provided
he cannot or fancies he cannot do exactly what
people look to him to do.</p>

<p>This praise and blame, coming from other people
and this looking to him, to do this or that, are both
examples of the control society is exerting on him
from childhood up. The clothes he wears, the
books he reads, the plays he sees, everything he
does is at least partly dictated to him by the people
with whom and among whom he lives. If he knows
people expect him to wear a linen collar and silk tie
he puts them on if he has them. If he has only a
collar he puts that on. If he has no linen collar he
possibly puts on a paper or celluloid one.</p>

<p>At any rate he gives them the next best thing in
any and every line coming up as far as possible to
their demands.</p>

<p>In sexual instincts there is only one conventional
demand; namely, that, except in marriage, he repress
them entirely. The next best thing, the celluloid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
collar, in this case, is any and everything
society calls non-sexual. He may waste his time
playing cards and his money on the races or the
stock market, and if he succeeds in getting excitement
enough out of them to prevent his thoughts
turning to sex topics he will have the comparative
approval of society. If he leaves women alone entirely
he will be called a clean man. Anything short
of actual criminality serves as the next best thing to
sex in the eyes of conventional society.</p>

<p>Society to date makes only this negative demand
on him. It as much as admits that it has nothing
to do with sex and still less with love. That simply
means that society is so blind it has not yet seen
that it can get anything out of sex, or of love either.
Society has no eyes, no arms, no lips. Why should
society be interested in the employment of these
parts of men in amatory ways? They need not expect
it to. They have no need to look to it for
such things.</p>

<p>Society on the other hand wants the individual’s
time and energy devoted entirely to professional,
commercial and artistic ends, and grudges him
every moment he spends in doing and thinking along
lines of pleasure and advantage to himself. Society
plans the rôle of the gods in the old Platonic fable
before mentioned (<a href="#section46">§ 46</a>) but has taken the half-humans
and halved them again.</p>

<p>Society, unlike the fabled gods, however, wishes
each of these to devote full time to making, manufacturing,
buying, selling, even fighting, which always
makes more work, but never to loving, which
it considers a mere waste of time. Children it wants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but they can be begotten without love; and the less
love the greater numbers.</p>

<p>Society therefore completely ignores the individual.
It tells him to make chairs and tables but
never to make love.</p>

<h3 id="section131">§ 131</h3>

<p>One has to reflect thus, so as to disentangle the
motives that rule one’s actions. The most individual
and intimately personal motive is love. One’s
strongest individuality, if one can discount society
and be oneself, is seen in the ability to make love.</p>

<p>What a man most controls is most himself.
Those actions that are most controlled by forces
<em>outside</em> of himself are least his own. In his thinking
he has to learn inseparably to link individuality
and self-control.</p>

<p>He has been taught from infancy to give up doing
what he wanted to do himself and do what other
people want. All other people want him to do almost
the opposite of what he wants to do himself
until, with punishments, retaliations, and all sorts
of rebuffs, their wants have snowed under his instinctive
desires with such an avalanche of prohibitions
that his actions are about ninety-nine per cent
controlled by the kind of selfishness that consists of
selfishly trying to please other people for a release
from this snow pressure, which release is called
approbation or praise.</p>

<p>The impulses which come from the avalanche are
the egoistic-social motives, social because they come
down upon him from everyone with whom he comes
in contact, egoistic because he is really protecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and pleasing himself by following these motives.</p>

<p>But one can see for himself how much of the
control of his ordinary every-day actions is his, how
much is the control of the avalanche.</p>

<p>Really then the only thing left to the individual
is his love impulse. Society is not interested in it,
or does not see that it is. Society would be a very
different thing if it had eyes. It might have some
sympathy. The individual’s love impulse is the one
bit of leaven in the human mass today. It is the
one thing he can call his own, the one thing whose
expression he can control. But society has taught
by implication that that is the one thing he cannot
control except by annihilation.</p>

<p>So it appears society has shown quite Machiavellian
abilities in checkmating the erotic impulse which
is the individual impulse par excellence. Society is
confronted with an apparently antisocial influence
and reacts to it on the low intellectual plane of
trying to destroy it.</p>

<h3 id="section132">§ 132</h3>

<p>But control is not annihilation nor is annihilation
control in any sense whatever. If you cannot train
a horse by shooting him dead, you cannot drive him
by poisoning him. If you do you haven’t got him.</p>

<p>If you kill your love impulse you haven’t got it.
You cannot kill it, but you can knock it in the head
so that it is unconscious. Ascetics have done it.
Society would as lief you did it yourself.</p>

<p>Your love impulse, not the Sunday school variety
but the full red-blooded variety of woman-loving
(or man-loving) impulse is not only the most individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thing about you because it is capable of the
most complex development in your case but it is
the most valuable dynamo you have generating endless
power whose source is the sun itself.</p>

<p>Control of the love impulse therefore, and not
annihilation of it, is the individual’s most personal
advantage.</p>

<h3 id="section133">§ 133</h3>

<p>An essential difference obtains between the average
man’s control and the average woman’s chiefly
in that the woman’s is a control by repression, virtually,
of course, no control at all; while the man’s
control wherever it exists is a control through expression.</p>

<p>It accords with the nature of masculinity and
femininity that the control of the woman’s erotism,
if it be a control through expression, is the control
exercised over it by the man. Any control she may
obtain over it cannot but be the control by repression.
In other words no woman has any control
over her own erotism except the ability to refuse to
express it, and even that she may lose if she meets
the right man. And no control is exercised over her
erotism except by her true mate, if she is thus developed
by him.</p>

<p>The man’s control over his own erotism is a real
control only after he has succeeded in freeing his
psyche from the mental autoerotism in which he has
been born, and has achieved a real allerotism. No
consideration need be given to the objection possibly
raised here by some; namely, that the double
standard of sexual morality that obtains so widely
may have given the man a taste of allerotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and may thus have given him a control through
expression. But it must be clearly understood that
no clandestine liaison of any sort whatever, except
where there is a true love of one woman, to the
social recognition of which there is some insuperable
barrier, has any real value as an erotic control
through expression.</p>

<p>Finally in the differentiation between masculine
and feminine erotic control it may be said that the
woman needs and can, by the nature of the circumstances,
have no control through expression herself.
She needs no release from her own natural autoerotism.
Her love problem is <i lang="la">toto cælo</i> different
from man’s.</p>

<h3 id="section134">§ 134</h3>

<p>The question—Are not all healthy men prone to
relax their erotic tensions more rapidly than
women?—may be answered. Possibly they are, but
they need not be. If a man is sick he is more likely
to feel like crying, yet he does not always do so.
If a man receives any great blow, he is proportionately
more likely to regress to the stage of infantility.</p>

<p>Healthy men, on the contrary, need not be short-winded
in the love episode any more than in playing
a baseball game, painting a picture, singing a song
or writing a book. It may be that no art can be
taught. Even if this is true, we shall always attempt
to teach arts of all kinds. It may be that the
art of love requires a certain amount of innate taste
in a man, for him to make any great progress.</p>

<p>History has shown a few great geniuses and a few
great lovers. Few great lovers figure in history because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the average human adult married lover has
no penchant for advertising himself. The average
childish married man can, however, learn to take
steps in the direction of adulthood in married relations,
even if he never becomes truly great as a
lover.</p>

<p>This is indeed the most important point of all.
Divorces in large numbers and unhappy marriages
in still larger numbers occur simply because the husband
will not have, or has not had the opportunity to
learn the main lessons of the married life, the greatest
of which is that it is his privilege to insure his
wife’s attainment of the erotic acme, preferably before
his own, but at least simultaneously, and every
time his own occurs.</p>

<p>They are not truly mated unless this plan of
simultaneity or succession is followed whole-heartedly.
If it is not now followed, it must be begun
at once, and the only method is through the appropriate
action of the husband.</p>

<p>A baby takes its mother’s milk and gives nothing
in return except smiles and gurgles and sleep. A
man taking his wife’s body and giving her no adult
emotional return for the emotional catharsis he gets
himself, except the infantile smile and sleep, is himself
no less a baby.</p>

<p>And she will “mother” or “baby” him, first, and
unconsciously hate him later. Asking him if he has
his rubbers, his umbrella, his overcoat and the thousand
and one things that more or less consciously
irritate him, show (but, in the average man, only
to his unconscious) that what really irritates him
in these minor solicitudes is his manifestly infantile
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section135">§ 135</h3>

<p>This complete lack, on the woman’s part, of any
ability whatsoever to secure erotic control over man
leads her to try, unconsciously, of course, to compensate,
for her inability in this region, by securing
egoistic-social control over man. This she succeeds
in doing every time she meets a man who has not
yet developed from a mental autoerotism, in which
he thinks that she has pleasures to bestow upon him
and that he has to get them from her, with or without
payment of egoistic-social services.</p>

<p>It thus appears that woman not only has no exclusively
erotic control, which by the nature of things
belongs entirely to man where he has developed
sufficiently to assume it, but also she invariably confuses
the two types of control, getting a vicarious
satisfaction from different forms of egoistic-social
control, and missing, in a great number of instances,
the deep biological and organic satisfactions from
the exercise of control over her by the man.</p>

<p>A hazy notion that happiness is her prerogative
at least in the first months of her marriage leads
many a woman to believe even to the extent of a
virtual hallucination that she <em>is</em> happy, i.e., that
she is erotically controlled by her husband.</p>

<p>A love episode in which this control has not been
secured by her husband, or in which he may not even
have tried to secure it leaves her in a state of psychical
conflict. She consciously knows she ought to be
supremely happy, unconsciously she feels blankly unhappy;
and if, as so many women are, she is without
erotic insight, she fancies that her husband has
slighted her in some purely egoistic-social action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Woman’s negative control in the erotic sphere results
in the complete depersonalization of her body.</p>

<h3 id="section136">§ 136</h3>

<p>Unconsciously as well as consciously she <em>wishes</em>
to find all pleasure in her honeymoon, and so strong
is that wish that she is impelled to believe that all
the several experiences of it are pleasurable. They
<em>must</em> be pleasurable or she must admit that at the
start even, she is <em>not</em> happily married. This is the
state of mind of those who enter the married state
with the most disingenuous sincerity. Those who
marry with any initial conflict, such as feelings of
guilt for any previous illicit sexual adventures, are
more unfortunate.</p>

<p>Those whose wishes for happiness are so strong
as to interpose a rose-coloured glass between their
eyes and their actual experiences are deceiving only
their conscious selves. One cannot deceive the unconscious.</p>

<p>Unconsciously they are disappointed in the lack
of rapport between their own emotional erotic situation
and their husbands’. They are in the position
of a starving man looking through a plate-glass
window, at a restaurant full of merry feasters.</p>

<p>According to her bringing up she may repress all
or a part, or none, of her natural resentment at this
situation; and the resentment is going eventually to
make her more exacting of her husband, if she is
to surrender to him even her impersonal body. For
impersonal her body does become even to her. She
regards it as belonging by law to him and she will
not virtually inhabit it when he is with it. At his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
approach she flees from it every time. And as this
flight is an unconscious, though a real flight, we
cannot blame her if her husband will not, or cannot,
take enough care of it and its reactions to enable
her to assimilate the necessary food of love.</p>

<p>She will think: “He says he loves me, but I know
only that he likes my body. I begin to hate it
because it does not give me the satisfaction it does
him. I can’t understand it a bit. It’s a strange
world. But I suppose it’s got to be as it is. I can’t
do anything about it.”</p>

<p>And she cannot, if he will not or cannot. Is there
any more powerful deterrent than despair to prevent
a young wife from being able to produce in
herself a relaxation of erotic tensions? Her usual
course, when she begins to despair thus is to deny
to herself that she has any sex feeling at all. Her
husband then agrees with her and calls her frigid.
This crystallization of her feelings not merely retards
but annihilates whatever abilities she has to
express her love in an erotic way. She fortifies herself
with the compensating thought that sex is, as
she has always heard, sinful, filthy, nauseating. Her
face begins to become hardened, to develop a
wrinkle or two and she is in a fair way to become
an anti-something.</p>

<p>She begins to realize that he has not done this
or that, such as remembering to post a letter or
make a purchase or keep an appointment with her;
or he has contradicted or opposed her in some judgment
concerning practical every-day occurrence. He
has not done what he should have done, to be sure;
but not only does she not know what that thing
is but she has no means of knowing what it is. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
therefore is forced to express her dissatisfaction with
him in terms of a sphere of impulse with which she
is acquainted; namely, the egoistic-social. She cannot
talk to him in a language of which she knows
not a single word.</p>

<p>The relations between a new bride and her husband
in their first love episode are those of an
examination or test. The bride tests the groom, of
course, in the majority of cases unconsciously.
There is nothing else for her to do. There is no
test she has to meet. By the circumstances of the
case she is not required to do anything for the conscious
performance of which she is to be judged
or tested by anyone. She has not to do but merely
to be, to exist—as if, asleep, to be awakened.</p>

<p>The unconscious situation is quite the reverse.
The husband is the one who is tested. If he fails
in any detail of this test there remains in the story
of his actions a lacuna which she has no means of
filling, but which forms the nucleus of a doubt in her
unconscious mind and the centre toward which all
subsequent failures on his part tend to congregate
in such numbers that she may become later completely
skeptical. She will say she knows he loves
her. To be sure, he does a thousand little things
for her all of egoistic-social, none of truly erotic
value.</p>

<p>If he even once takes these virtually friendly, unconscious
examinings of hers as real evidence of
hostility or lack of interest, he is failing her where
she feels it most keenly, and is beginning to lose
his control of her erotically. If he continues to be
switched off the main track by her well-nigh inquisitorial
attitude he as much as admits to her that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
is not longer able to come up to her standards—a
humiliating admission for any man to make to any
woman.</p>

<p>Kittens are born blind. Women are born love-blind.
No woman is other than anesthetic, which
means “not perceiving” until she has perceived
something. And there is nothing for her to perceive
except what her husband does.</p>

<p>Woman’s negative control, coming as it does
from her anesthesia which is innate in her and is
removed only by the proper kind of marriage, makes
her “uncertain, coy and hard to please.” If not met
and handled erotically by a man who has abandoned
autoerotism, it develops in her a degree of opposition,
antagonism, obstinacy and resistance that is
completely misunderstood by a man without erotic
insight.</p>

<h3 id="section137">§ 137</h3>

<p>Women confuse the control on the egoistic level
with that on the erotic level, because the latter
prompts them to keep testing their men in the unconscious
attempt to assure themselves of their own
security. This testing is done on both levels. When
it is done on the upper or superficial level of egoistic-social
acts it takes the form of all varieties of fantastic
and capricious behaviour. The most “temperamental”
woman is using her moods only to try the
steadfastness of the man concerned, although she is
quite unaware of the unconscious motive. She either
cannot explain her actions or she assigns reasons
that are pure rationalizations. When the testing is
done on the erotic level it sometimes assumes the
form of coldness or anesthesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Women will later come to see that their use of
egoistic-social tests is only an indirect manner (and
never a reliable one) of assuring their erotic security,
but they will attain this insight only after
they have made the distinction between the two
groups of motives and have given to the erotic its
true superior value.</p>

<p>If the young bride has had the good fortune to
be enlightened on sexual matters, and thus to be
prepared for a descent upon her of an expression
of force which otherwise is easily too great a shock,
she may even welcome its impetuosity.</p>

<p>If on the other hand, as is almost universally the
case, she is ignorant of sex, her reaction to an uncontrolled
husband will be one of utter despair.
The majority of educated women today have been
brought up with all the inhibitions which crass ignorance
of sexual psychology produces. As a precautionary
measure many of them were instructed
by their mothers that boys and men are uncontrolled
brutes and should not be allowed to touch girls, who
are destined to become married mothers.</p>

<p>Therefore the majority of women enter the married
state with faces at least slightly averted from
sex, just as some religious sects train their believers
to wash in the dark and never under any circumstances
to look at their bodies undraped, much less
any other persons’.</p>

<p>So the chance is that the husband will have as
his first duty to eradicate this sex inhibition, for
which his wife is in no way to blame, for as a child
she started in the right direction, and was misdirected
by her parents, guardians or teachers.</p>

<p>If a man is constitutionally unable, or has trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
himself to be unable, to control his own emotional
catharsis, and must see to his own satisfaction, before
(or even instead of) his wife’s, the prognosis
of happiness, if he gets a woman with the sex inhibition,
is negative.</p>

<h3 id="section138">§ 138</h3>

<p>That the soul as well as the body of the newly
married, in their first love episode, should be inexplicable
and unreservedly “blended with the only
other soul and body in all the world for him” certainly
requires a mental ante-nuptial preparation
that has rarely been attained in the past. It implies
the belief on the man’s part that the woman should
have <em>from the first</em> exactly the same true physical
and psychical ecstasy that he expects himself. How
many men think that?</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, as has been indicated
above, that the woman’s erotic development
progresses, and that in some cases it takes months
and even years for it to reach its full expansion.
In the meantime the hasty, anesthetic husband has
lost his grip and, unconsciously unwilling to grow up
with his wife, remains at his selfish, animal level.</p>

<p>Incidentally, too, he holds his wife there; for it
must be remembered that the wife’s erotic development,
on which depends not merely her contentment,
but the stark possibility of her becoming more than
a gynecoid female, is absolutely nil, if it be not
developed by her husband. This is unequivocally a
one-way process. All the latent love and beauty of
being and action on the woman’s part are dependent
solely on the ability of her husband to unfold her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section139">§ 139</h3>

<p>It may be argued that the woman’s erotic acme
is conditioned by the prior or simultaneous emergence
of the man’s. But this argument is the working
out of a defence mechanism coming from the
unconscious of the man. He makes this statement
not because it is true but because, from an autoerotic
phantasy, he wishes it were true.</p>

<p>The statement, too, may be sincerely made by
the woman, but, if it is, it is because she has heard
him make it or correctly inferred from his unconscious
actions its tacit existence in his mind. It is
shown in another place that there is always in the
man’s unconscious a phantasy that his part in the
love episode will produce his wife’s erotic acme at
once and without effort on his part. This phantasy
amounts in some cases to an hallucination.</p>

<h3 id="section140">§ 140</h3>

<p>It was said above that you cannot control what
you cannot see or touch or otherwise perceive. To
what you cannot see, you are blind; to what you
cannot hear, you are deaf; to what you cannot smell
you are—but there is no English word for that, so
we have had to take a Greek word—<i>anosmic</i>. Similarly
if you could not taste, touch, feel, you would
be insensible. There are many more forms of insensibility
than merely being knocked out in a fight.
The insensibility to the penultimate one of the various
phases of the love episode has been called in a
woman anesthesia. In the love episode of the hasty
husband there are innumerable reactions of his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to which he is insensible, anesthetic; but which would
be a revelation of supreme joy to him if he could
but see them; therefore it is better that the love
episodes should take place in the light rather than
in the dark.</p>

<p>Yet not alone the visually perceptible reactions.
For there are reactions of every variety. If you
have ever used a blow pipe on a piece of copper, and
observed the iridescence which soon comes, you will
realize the same beauties in every sense preceding
the complete annealing of your wife by the heat of
passion you engender in her. If you have ever
watched the iridescence of a spraying fountain in
the sun, you will see the same effect in the emotions
of your wife when the relaxation of tension has
broken up her being into fine particles that float
slowly down and refract the light rays of your love.
And the beauty and calm of the rainbow after a
summer storm is nothing to that of the mental state
of a woman after the downpour of her erotic passion.</p>

<p>All these are features to which the anesthetic man
is insensible. Although the similes used are visual,
there is not a sense quality that cannot be thrilled
by the perception of the woman’s reactions. And
although the similes rather hint at the finale than
at the preliminaries they all refer to the effect produced
on the woman by the activities of the man.
The kinesthetic sense of the husband must be developed.
He is much wiser if he will give these
sensations some appreciative study. It will help to
give him control by taking his mind off the burden
of tension he has to carry himself, and enable him
to acquire over his wife that domination in the exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
erotic sphere which is essential not only
to his wife’s happiness but to his own.</p>

<h3 id="section141">§ 141</h3>

<p>Anesthesia is love-blindness. Love is pictured
blind because he does not see <em>defects</em>. The worst
blindness of love is its not seeing beauties. Most
husbands’ love is blind. This is the anesthesia
meant. When one is given surgically an anesthetic
it is to make one insensible to pain. Love anesthesia
is the insensibility to the love emotions which are
stirred in every man by every woman.</p>

<p>Can a man be aware of these appeals, made by
every woman, and choose to remain true to the
woman he has married? What good would be done
to him if the anesthetic to which, by virtue of conventional
repression, we are all subject, should be
suddenly removed? Would not such a man be irresistibly
impelled to make love to any and every
woman he saw? Where then would monogamy be?
But if monogamy depended on anesthetics of this
type it would be on a very insecure basis. It would
not endure a week.</p>

<p>Yet most men are love-blind, are anesthetic to
woman’s deepest erotic appeal. Furthermore the
securest protection for monogamy is the removal of
that anesthesia.</p>

<h3 id="section142">§ 142</h3>

<p>This doctrine of the supremity of masculine erotic
control will be objected to, and by the best of
women. They will say that they get their joy in
perfect marriage from the knowledge that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
husbands are made happy. They will also say that
it is only fair play if there is a give and take on
both sides, and that the denial of woman’s control
relegates them to an inferior position.</p>

<p>They misunderstand, however, the biological
foundations of the marital state if they consider
woman’s position of receiver and not giver as in
any way implying inferiority. They confuse erotic
control, which is demonstrably a one-way control,
with egoistic-social control, which is quite as normally
exercised by women as by men, by women
over men, as by men over women.</p>

<p>They fail to see also that the secure establishment
of the one-way masculine erotic control will
so satisfy men that no dispute can arise as to the
rights of women in the egoistic-social sphere. They
fail to see also that the solid foundation of truly
erotic control over them by their husbands will release
for egoistic-social activities an enormous fund
of energy which is now irrationally locked up in the
erotic sphere. In other words if they are fortunate
enough to be married to a man who is in perfect
control erotically they will not need to worry about
his approval of whatever they may find interesting
to do in egoistic-social spheres of action.</p>

<h3 id="section143">§ 143</h3>

<p>The excellent women who may on theoretical
grounds, object to their husbands’ supreme erotic
control, are merely echoing the sentiments of traditional
convention, which are man-made sentiments,
made by men centuries ago, dictating what was right
and proper for women to do centuries ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Today there is nothing, even in the ordinary
every-day service a man receives from his wife that
he would not rather have servants do for him—cooking,
house-tending, clothes-mending or the supervision
of these. If he were rich enough he would.</p>

<p>But the personality reaction in the most intimate
psychical as well as physical relations of married
life he can secure from no other than a true wife,
and in no other sphere than the exclusively erotic
and in no other way than as she, like the vibrating
string of a musical instrument, responds to his technique.</p>

<h3 id="section144">§ 144</h3>

<p>The main thesis of this book is that in the instincts
and emotions of love the self-control of the
husband and, through this, his control of the exclusively
erotic emotions of his wife are essential
to a successful marriage.</p>

<p>A continuous interplay of control on the egoistic-social
level between husband and wife tends to exist
in all marriages. There is an impulse in women to
control the actions of men at this level quite as
much as men attempt to control women. But the
control of the egoistic-social impulses of each by the
other has nothing to do with real marriage, and the
impulses and emotions peculiar to it, which are
erotic only and, at that, subject to a one-way control.</p>

<p>In the sphere of the erotic emotions man should
be supreme. Neither husband nor wife is ever really
happy unless he has this control, and is indifferent
to the other control on the egoistic-social level.</p>

<p>The facts that control is neither annihilation nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
repression, that control is of the very essence of
personality and individuality, that biologically man’s
control of woman is the only control needed in the
erotic sphere, and that woman, not being able to
control there (and feeling, if she be not controlled,
a need which she unconsciously interprets as a need
to control others)—all these are facts that are of
slight importance, however striking they may be,
compared with the fact that man, on the average,
is brought up without knowledge of the erotic control
he needs to assume in order to make both himself
and his wife happy.</p>

<p>The unsatisfied woman experiences the fact that
she has bestowed upon her mate unutterable joy and
bliss. A satisfied woman’s recognition of this fact,
however, cannot occur at the same time that her
own erotic acme takes place, for at that particular
time she is as oblivious to anything save her own
sensations as if she were the only being existing in
the universe, and her sensations are as indefinite
and infinite as though she were taking chloroform.
She must, in all the processes leading up to her temporary
psychic dissolution, realize that these processes
are being accomplished for her by the being
and doing of her husband-lover. She may not ever
know exactly what he does do, but she is translated—and
by her husband.</p>

<h3 id="section145">§ 145</h3>

<p>The man of the twentieth-century type gets his
supreme gratification, not from anything that is
done to him, nor yet from any sensations which his
activities produce in him, which indeed he could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
blindfolded from any living woman of similar proportions
and somatic reaction, but from the knowledge
his own visual and tactual sense gives him of
the effect of his acts on his partner, the physical
and psychical effect which his being and doing have
not on himself directly (which is the ordinary autoerotic
procedure) but indirectly on him through the
body and soul of his mate.</p>

<p>The analogous statement cannot be made about
the woman. To be sure, she both is loved and loves,
both is desired and desires, but she can herself do
nothing that gives the man other than autoerotic
pleasure. His joy, on the contrary, comes not from
what she does to gratify him directly. His appreciation
and response to any artful action on her part
is a feminine reaction, and while excusable in egoistic
spheres of action is inexcusable in the erotic.</p>

<p>For he neither wants her, nor does she want,
essentially and biologically, to be the active, creative
factor in the love episode, just because this factor
is the exclusively masculine factor. Her unconscious
reaction to this reversal of masculinity and
femininity may amuse her for a while, as a variation;
but it cannot continue. Conscious purposive
action on her part gives neither her nor him a lasting
gratification, as it is a step in the direction of
psychic autoerotism on his part to receive such satisfactions.</p>

<p>Her reactions on the contrary should have such
a degree of spontaneity and unreflective artlessness
as to give him assurance of their being true unmeditated
responses as sure and inevitable as the chemical
action in an opening flower, but as purely hypersomatic
(spiritual) as they are inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Otherwise, he will never be able to know her as
she is. He will know her as the traditional suggestion
of her environment has taught her to be. This
pervasive influence of environment, which is well
enough in egoistic-social impulses, is wholly out of
place in the erotic sphere.</p>

<p>The truly modern husband will wish more than
any other thing to know his wife as he himself alone
can know her, and will more and more consciously
resent, as the century grows older, any egoistic-social
conventionality slipping into the purely erotic.</p>

<p>In order for him to gain his greatest joy from
marriage with this particular woman, she will have
to be made <i lang="la">sui generis</i>. The only means toward
this end is her utterly unpremeditated, spontaneous
response, unclouded by the suggestions of tradition
as to how she ought to respond.</p>

<p>A woman thus rendered <i lang="la">sui generis</i> by her husband’s
erotic control will more than fulfil any requirements
or specifications of a pattern of romantic
love. Such a woman, thus known by a fully
percipient husband, takes on for him a value, transcending
far those of the ordinary so-called loves
of the every-day, mildly contented variety, and becomes
for him alone, incandescent with vitality.</p>

<p>The considerations offered in the preceding paragraphs
point to the conclusion that the average
man’s lack of erotic control is due first of all to his
mental autoerotism.</p>

<p>Man’s lack of erotic control is due also partly
to a certain anesthesia on his part, taking the word
in its etymological sense of a failure to perceive.</p>

<p>He fails to perceive that his function in married
life is giving and not receiving. He also fails to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
perceive the difference between woman’s spontaneous
reactions and those suggested to her by her
environment. He fails to perceive that woman’s
resistance has a deep biological cause and that she
is unconsciously forced to test him hourly. He fails
to perceive that she inevitably confuses erotic and
egoistic-social instincts.</p>

<h3 id="section146">§ 146</h3>

<p>The man to whom the love episode is only an
animal sex act, a swift and dizzy whirl, is one who,
so to speak does not in advance plot out the trajectory
of this flight, does not let the component
factors enter his consciousness for long enough to
observe them and devote some conscious love to
them. These innate associations are there in his
unconscious; but his training has repressed them.
Such a man to whom the love episode is like a swift
gulping of strong liquor has no time to reflect upon
its various bouquets and glints in natural and artificial
light.</p>

<p>The ideal enactment of the love episode, if permitted
to enter consciousness in the proper manner,
enables one to prolong it, because this admittance
of new factors into consciousness, that were all
along in the unconscious, gives a reason for stopping
and taking account of the phases of it as they occur.
The most important phases are those where the
husband takes note of the effects of his being and
doing upon his wife. The hasty husband is the
one who has no regard for any other’s feelings save
his own. If his own were the only ones that existed,
he would of course have no reason to retard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
own erotic acme. With an insensate spouse he
might go through the love episode as often and as
rapidly as he wished.</p>

<p>It must be kept in mind always that there is a
definite biological cause for the slow progress of
woman through the phases of the love episode—the
inescapable necessity that she shall assure herself
continuously and beyond the slightest doubt of
the erotic strength of her partner.</p>

<p>It is probable that the women who are not slow
in this progress are in a sense degenerate, if that
term have any real meaning. They would be the
ones who would not, unconsciously, of course, express
that biological need for impregnation by the
strongest male, which is expressed by the average
woman in her slowness. They would tend to reproduce
what might be called a lower order of humans
in which the erotic in itself, the hypersomatically or
spiritually erotic plays a much smaller part, an
order of humans that were nearer the animals than
those humans who have amplified the erotic factor.</p>

<p>The hasty husband, as will later be shown
(<a href="#section158">§ 158</a>), unconsciously reasons that his own speed
demonstrates his quick and masterful control over
his wife’s erotic emotions. This unconscious fallacy
is made worse if the wife has followed the doctor’s
advice to simulate an erotic acme in order to preserve
the marital peace.</p>

<p>If the effect on her of his mere presence were so
overwhelming, and if, as soon as he embraced her,
she soared into the empyrean of ecstatic bliss, his
mere embrace might have the effect at once of producing,
in her, her own erotic acme. This would,
however, imply either that she was herself weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
judged by the standard just given, or that she had
assumed, without testing, his superior strength in
the erotic sphere.</p>

<p>This assumption is an exceedingly rare one, depending
on an inference from mere physical muscular
strength, or from the fact of a great egoistic-social
reputation. In other words such a woman
might think that because her husband was or is
an athlete his physical strength implies erotic
strength, or that because he was a famous man he
would be a great lover.</p>

<h3 id="section147">§ 147</h3>

<p>The husband’s lack of erotic control based on
his own lack of perception renders him too precipitant
in the love episode.</p>

<p>It is believed, on the authority of physicians and
such others as have studied the subject, that the
love episode, in about seventy per cent of civilized
marriages, is but a one-sided affair from the first.
This is due almost exclusively to the impetuosity of
the husband during the first weeks of marriage.
Sometimes under the inspiration of the purity of
his bride-to-be, or from an increased cautiousness
against the chances of contracting venereal disease,
he abstains from resorting to prostitutes.</p>

<p>If this practice of his has come from a belief on
his part that he was obliged, as he believes all men
are, to relax his sexual tension periodically, he will
generally believe that his temporary pre-marital
continence is piling up tension in him, and he will
approach his bride for the first time with an idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
probably that his tension is greater than it has ever
been in his life.</p>

<p>A very important distinction must here be kept
in mind; namely, that between the perfect erotic
love episode, free from conflict, and involving both
hyper- and hyposomatic levels of the personality,
and the imperfect, illicit sex act. It has been pointed
out<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that the physical sex act does not relax a
true love tension, that the instinct itself may not be
satisfied even with numerous hyposomatic sex activities.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the young husband be of the type
that believes that an illicit sex act invariably produces
the desired relaxation of erotic tension, he
will be the more likely to give way to an impulse
that has a large proportion of the purely hyposomatic
(or physical) factor in it. This abandon on
his part will exclude all possibility of mutuality.
He will thus lose at the start the possibility of
that control which he might have gained over his
wife’s erotic reactions, had he been able to control
his own. And he would have been able to control
his own but for the erroneous belief that the tensions
he relaxed clandestinely with the <i lang="fr">demimondaine</i>
were the main tensions, which undoubtedly
they are not.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the annihilation of his bride’s
natural responsive actions that results from his
faulty procedure is fatal to married happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section148">§ 148</h3>

<p>This hastiness marks the love episode on the part
of the average man. What he wants is a reaction
that is to take place in himself, for which his bride
is merely the external complementary mechanism.
The purely mechanical side of this he could either
purchase from a courtesan or seize against her will
from an innocent “honest” girl, but he fears venereal
disease in the former and trouble of accidental
paternity or discovery or both in the case of the
latter. Eventually he regards both types of women
with equal impersonality. Either is merely food
for his sexual (not erotic in the highest sense)
hunger, and it is his own sex hunger that he is bent
on appeasing, with absolutely no idea of the difference
in erotic value between the two types of
women, in the way he acts. There is none, for
neither is more appropriate to his spiritual need
than hay would be for his stomach.</p>

<p>The man who desires a wife either for the purely
sexual or for the purely domestic motive has no conception
of marriage whatever. If he is influenced
either consciously, or unconsciously by such a motive
he might as far as his own sole advantage is
concerned, confine himself to sexual affairs with
prostitutes. He is unaware of the new light that
has been thrown on love by the recently acquired
knowledge of the work of the ductless glands. He
has never heard of them, of course, and could not
be expected to know how intimately they are connected
with each other and with his entire mental
and physical welfare.</p>

<p>What he later finds out, and that with no help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
whatever from science, but from tough experience,
is that the two things that he craves—namely, sexual
satisfaction and all the good things of domestic life—are
in some way inevitably and more and more
sundered. His wife either is and remains “cold”
or acquires suddenly or gradually a coolness which
increases to actual pseudo-frigidity. He notices a
change in her. He knows he has not himself
changed.</p>

<p>The change should have been in him and then
there would have been in her a change which would
have gratified him instead of disappointing him.
But, never having been taught how to behave in the
most intimate relations of marriage, he is feeling
the results of his ignorance just as would a landlubber
feel eventually the resulting shipwreck if he
undertook, or were forced against his will, to pilot
a big ship. The husband should be the matrimonial
pilot, but he has received no course of instruction
in that form of navigation.</p>

<h3 id="section149">§ 149</h3>

<p>Haste in the husband comes primarily from fear.
Fear makes the thief hurry through his thieving.
The pickpocket must be so deft and swift that the
victim’s consciousness is not aroused to the theft.
But a true husband-lover is not, in the love episode,
stealing anything from his wife, no matter how
much his actions may resemble those of a thief. His
aim should be not to avoid arousing her consciousness,
but to awaken it to the gift he is offering her.</p>

<p>Fear makes anyone telescope, curtail, syncopate
and abbreviate any act, selecting out of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
portions of the act some element of it, considered
perhaps the cream of it, and cutting out all the
rest of it. Fear alone—the fear felt by the thief—is
unconscious motive enough for haste on the husband’s
part. If he did not fear her erotic acme,
or her reactions that occur prior to it, he would
not repress them, or allow her to repress them.
Why should he fear to give his wife the same erotic
acme in every love episode that he uniformly gives
himself?</p>

<p>He fears—unconsciously, to be sure, for the most
part—that, if his wife develops so strong an erotic
reaction, she may have an irresistible craving to
satisfy herself when he is not present, thus giving
herself to another.</p>

<p>Haste in the husband is therefore due to a fear
that he may lose his wife’s passion, if it be aroused.
He does not realize that the modern educated civilized
woman is unable to give herself to any but the
one man who has first aroused her deepest passion;
and that the more educated and cultivated she is, the
more surely she is centred upon the one man about
whose being the entire erotic sphere rotates as on
an axis.</p>

<p>Man’s fear that his wife may be or become “oversexed”
is at least a part of the cause for his haste
in the love episode. Unconsciously, of course, he
does not want her to have the same ecstatic pleasure
as he has himself. Not only because, in his squinting
regard, this puts her in the prostitute class, but
also because he fears her becoming too passionate
for one man and therefore requiring two or more.
This is based on an undercurrent of opinion among
men that a woman’s sexuality is fundamentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stronger than a man’s; and that her comparative
leisure in view of his own, will tend to foster in
her the desire for sexual gratification.</p>

<p>Added to this is the other erroneous supposition,
common among ignorant men, that excessive indulgence
in the pleasures of the love episode has a weakening
effect on the man. Viewed as excretions, as
the seminal products have been until today, it would
seem quite illogical to fear an evacuation of these
at least once a day. But although they have been
regarded as excreta, there has always been an
unconscious belief in men that their retention somehow
strengthened the brain. Still a way has been
pointed out (see <a href="#section100">§ 100</a>) for the love episodes to be
continued without this fear.</p>

<p>A consideration favouring the erroneous belief
that the seminal products should not be ejaculated
too freely is the phenomenon of a certain lassitude
and inactivity following the love (?) episode as it
has been hastily put through by many men. On
the contrary the perfectly balanced love episode
cannot have this unpleasant result. It ensues only
when the episode has been imperfect either through
too great haste or through the lack of suitable response
on the wife’s part. If both share equally,
i.e., if the husband reserves his own acme, the
result is perfect. It cannot be perfect in any other
way than that perfectly shared in flawless mutuality.
The evocation of the suitable response on the wife’s
part lies wholly in the husband’s self-control.
Whether the effect is caused principally by psychical
or by physical causes, it is he that in all cases is
responsible. Without his proper conducting of the
love episode, she is impotent and anesthetic. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
cannot feel what he does not do. She cannot see
what he does not show her. Who can blame her if
her unconscious passion, over which she has never
had, has not now and never will have any control,
is magnetized by the really superior conduct of another
man?</p>

<p>In brief, divorce is in the power of the husband
to render imperative or impossible. The wife has
essentially nothing to say in the matter except that
she has found in her husband a rover among women,
a beast that treats her brutally or an ignoramus
who is not competent to be either a good husband
or a good father.</p>

<h3 id="section150">§ 150</h3>

<p>Some men are always delighting the conscious life
of women by the intensity and frequency and rapidity
of their emotional relaxations. Such men seem
so generous in their spending of the small change
of emotion. But they are always maddening the
unconscious of their women, whether these women
be wives or mistresses, for they are repeatedly,
almost universally, taking in the woman’s presence,
and through the instrumentality of her presence,
what she cannot herself get, and what she has biologically
an expectancy, if not a right, to have. Such men
are practically annihilating the chances of their own
and their wives’ happiness.</p>

<p>The woman that is governed by the egoistic-social
instinct unwittingly plans for the man’s hasty emotional
relaxation, the while completely holding her
own emotional reactions in check, under perfect
repressive control. In the average civilized woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
brought up under sex inhibitions this control by
annihilation is the only control she has. The ability
thus to annihilate the finest possibilities of erotic
reaction in herself is the result of the only training
many women get. It is the fine art of the prostitute,
but not all of hers, however. The rest of it
is to simulate a loss of control on her own part in
order to effect the aggrandizement and unconscious
sense of superiority on the part of her patrons.</p>

<p>This conscious retaining of erotic control is, to
be sure, based on the biological necessity of man
testing. The best of women cannot of themselves let
go their own erotic control. It has to be taken from
them by men who are emotionally their superiors in
strength.</p>

<p>In so far as it (woman’s tendency to lie) is
“almost physiological”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and based on radical feminine
characteristics, such as modesty, affectability
and sympathy, which have an organic basis in the
feminine constitution, and can therefore never altogether
be changed, feminine dissimulation seems
scarcely likely to disappear.</p>

<p>Woman’s tendency to dissemble is dependent on
her unconscious reaction of testing the male. But
she must test her male for the deeply biological
purpose of finding out whether he is strong enough
for her. He needs to be, for her purposes, only
stronger than she is, to be strong enough; although,
when this motive is sometimes transferred to consciousness,
she may become a fortune hunter or
vampire, and throw away any man for the next
egoistic-socially stronger she finds available. This
does not of course refer to physical muscular strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
but to psycho-sexual strength. If physical strength
were enough there would be almost no divorces and
no marital unhappiness.</p>

<h3 id="section151">§ 151</h3>

<p>Her testing her male, therefore, whether it is in
pre-marital egoistic-social relations or after marriage
erotically, is a resort to the negativism (which
is indeed a characteristic of infantility). This
negativism is seen in the critical attitude which is so
intense in some of the later incidents in married
life. And in the first love episode any coolness on
the bride’s part is a tacit resistance which seems to
say: “I am not yet fully mastered. Any opposition
I present to you is no more than what as a
man you should be able to overcome. You may be
my superior in physical strength but there are numerous
kinds of strength. I did not obviously
marry you for your physical strength much as I
appreciate, value and need it. But the love
episode,” she continues unconsciously, in blushes,
averted gaze, occasional paleness, interspersed with
impulsive advances, all of which are here set down
in their equivalent words, “the love episode consists
in far more than physical violence. In fact for
many centuries physical violence has formed no
essential part of it. It has on the other hand a
tendency to fluctuating, wavering, more or less trembling
behaviour, that to the uninitiated appears contradictory
or inanely silly. If you are upset or
disconcerted audibly or visibly by any of the obstructions
I am placing in your way, you are really not
strong enough for me. By my instinctive need for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
being controlled, I am impelled to see how much
strain you can bear, how strong your mental and
spiritual nature is, for I need that control more
than anything else in the world. I hope you will not
fail me at this juncture, for I want above all things
to find a firm base to which to attach the wavering,
vacillating, fluctuating algæ of my emotions.”</p>

<p>All this she says in her actions, while her words
may be: “Oh, Rob, you certainly are awkward.
You don’t understand me a bit.”</p>

<p>How tragic if Rob should take her words as
gospel truth and substantiate them by showing any
irritation whatever!</p>

<h3 id="section152">§ 152</h3>

<p>Possibly this is the place to say that if the young
husband shows surprise or, worse, irritation at any
of the, to him, seemingly bizarre acts of his new
wife, he is providing her with exactly the reaction
which her careful and thorough unconscious is looking
for, finding which it says to itself: “Well, if
I find many of these defects, farewell! I’ll attach
myself to some other man.”</p>

<p>Whereas consciously she is triumphant in her
power over him to make him anything from miserable
to blissful.</p>

<p>This unconscious tendency to test the husband,
based on the biological necessity of choosing a mate
at least slightly stronger spiritually, psychically,
mentally than herself, determines much of the
actions of a maid with a man.</p>

<p>In married couples where the man is properly
schooled in love, this wrangling on a low level does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not take place except at its minimum at the outset.
Frequently the woman immediately senses, unconsciously,
that the man whose attentions she is receiving
is of the stronger type necessary to compel
her emotional submission.</p>

<p>This theory admits the possibility of perfect marriage
between the lowest and highest types of intellect
(which is an egoistic-social expression, not
erotic) with proportionally happy results.</p>

<p>It also shows how every married couple can reinstate
themselves in the most satisfactory mutual
relation, even if they have already started on the
wrong path.</p>

<p>If the husband realizes that he is only being
tested, and by a sympathetic examiner who really
wants him to pass the test, and that it requires only
a little thinking on his own part to make him
erotically a fully followed husband instead of a led
one, he will certainly give the necessary time to
visualizing the pattern his actions will have to take
thereafter in order to make him successful.</p>

<p>In married couples where the man does not know
or cannot learn the erotic principles, the surface
wrangling based on the perpetual unconscious test
continues, involving more and more of the couple’s
egoistic-social activities, until finally it becomes so
acute that nothing can prevent an open rupture.</p>

<p>In other couples where the man’s reactions satisfactorily
answer the woman’s first tacit interrogation,
the dramatic testing automatically stops.</p>

<p>Woman’s tendency to dissemble thus includes
not merely verbal lies but also all forms of her
behaviour toward her husband. Of course, if her
erotic nature is entirely engaged she will have (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
example) no possible motive to spend his money
above what is needed for pleasing him through her
developing her own personality in every way, or in
acting in any capacity whatever that would in an
egoistic-social sense be to his detriment, for through
the perfect love episode she so strongly identifies
herself with him that all his interests, even the
egoistic-social, are superlatively hers, quite in contrast
with the wife whose love impulses have been
ungratified.</p>

<p>The wife with the ungratified love impulse reacting
unconsciously, as described above, with irritated
but unsatisfied desires, unconsciously reasons to herself
on the talion plan because she has not risen
from that to total identification. The irritated but
unsatisfied wife, still on the “eye for eye” level of
reaction, unconsciously says to herself: “If I cannot
get something out of him one way, I will
another, to pay for all he is getting out of me. If
I cannot make him give me a real love episode I will
make him give me other things. I will buy what I
want and send him the bill. He shall give me money
if he cannot give love. Love is what I want but
I must have something.” This is unspoken, but still
it exists.</p>

<h3 id="section153">§ 153</h3>

<p>A man cannot feel what isn’t there without phantasying
up to the point of hallucination. But what
isn’t there is simply what he hasn’t put there in the
way of response to appropriate action on his own
part. He cannot put it there if he is mentally
autoerotic. (<a href="#section112">§ 112</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>He must know in advance what to expect, and
what is the necessary expression of woman’s erotic
feelings. If he does not, he is doomed to surprise
of an unpleasant character; for he will either be
disappointed when he finds that his wife’s reactions
are not up to his narrowly limited pattern or he
will be embarrassed by a too great gush of feeling
on her part and an arousal of passion so tremendous
that he does not know how to handle it.</p>

<p>This embarrassment is related to a certain type
of mild disgust or aversion felt by men to whom
some women make advances not considered truly
feminine by the men. This does not refer to the
brazen self-assertiveness of the prostitute which is
by most men clearly recognized as egoistic-social.
It refers to a truly erotic abandon sometimes seen
in a woman who absolutely throws herself upon the
man that has inspired her fancy. This attitude
makes impossible for some men the satisfaction of
victory or conquest.</p>

<p>This too great abandon on the woman’s part
evokes in such a man the thought either that she
is sexually more potent than he (an erotic reaction
in no way connected with egoistic-social impulses);
or that her own environment has been such as to
bring out this expression in her. If she has been
brought up in a family where love needs are frankly
recognized, their wholesomeness will make her much
more responsive, at once, to her husband’s love.</p>

<p>Naturally he will be neither embarrassed nor dismayed,
if he has himself been trained to believe that
his capacity for woman’s love is, if fully developed,
as great as or greater than any woman’s could be.
If he was thus well oriented, he would be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
rather than otherwise to be relieved of the task
of removing love’s inhibitions from his wife.</p>

<h3 id="section154">§ 154</h3>

<p>Fate is inscrutable and mysterious. Dame Fortune
is a mother-imago. The husband who does
not understand his wife is a child who does not
understand his mother. According to her fancy
she may give or not give what he wants her to bestow
upon him. Children comparatively early learn
to manage their mothers, but the man who has
failed to learn how to control his wife erotically has
not advanced even as far as these children.</p>

<p>Such men are the ones who profess to revere the
mystery in the feminine nature. They are simply
a case of arrested emotional development. There
should be no mystery in marriage. There is plenty
of room for passion and romance without demanding
that there shall be in it any mystery whatever.
The inscrutability of the mysterious expression on
the face of the <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> was the expression of
Leonardo’s extreme infantility, the erotic childishness
of a man who never really loved a woman as
a man should.</p>

<p>Man’s projection of mystery upon woman is his
infantile attitude toward her expressing his unconscious
desire not to give but to receive.</p>

<p>What constitutes the husband’s complete erotic
control is the removal of all mystery, his full perception
of all the factors in the erotic situation. One
of these is the actual fact as to whether or not his
wife has in the love episode reached the erotic acme.</p>

<p>He frequently thinks, if he is one of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
men without insight, that she has; when as a fact she
has not.</p>

<p>It is sublimely stupid for a doctor to tell the wife
to pretend that she has reached the erotic acme in
every love episode, and to say that no man can tell
whether or not she has reached that degree of
exaltation; so she might as well deceive him in order
to keep the marital peace. Such men as follow
this advice have not the remotest resemblance to
human men, nor do they deserve to retain the love
of their wives even if they have once gained it.
One can tell whether a person is <em>unconscious</em> or not,
or if she sleeps or not. A real husband can tell
whether or not his wife has reached the erotic
acme.</p>

<h3 id="section155">§ 155</h3>

<p>The unconscious inference of a man’s reaching the
erotic acme is that his wife has done the same in
the erotic episode or surely will when he does. This
feeling is so strong as to make almost everyone
take the sign for the thing signified. The thing
signified is the woman’s utter surrender. It is
signified by the sign, which is the man’s losing or
letting go his own control. Prior to the wife’s
erotic acme there is no time during the love episode
when the husband’s loss of control will not affect his
wife’s unconscious adversely. She will surely though
unconsciously resent his throwing down his burden
of tension before he has torn hers from her, because
his own tenseness is his only instrument wherewith
to operate on hers. His desire lapses with his
relaxation. Her relaxation cannot take place if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
loses his tenseness before she does, even if it be
only one second before.</p>

<p>Men would make happy marriage certain if they
should universally grasp this idea; namely, that their
letting themselves go entirely without the prior or
simultaneous erotic acme on the part of their
wives, is putting themselves on the same level as the
animals without, however, being in the animal environment.</p>

<p>To that level the wives cannot sink; yet the
husbands allow themselves to do so almost without
exception. Because of centuries of repression their
wives are not able to respond to the erotic situation
as rapidly as they do themselves, and yet the husbands
act as if they responded fully. This type of
behaviour is practically equivalent to producing a
hallucination in themselves.</p>

<p>To use a term from pathological psychology,
every husband who does not secure his wife’s erotic
acme before or with his own, actually <em>hallucinates</em>,
for his own benefit, that reaction on her part. He is
exactly like a man walking along a level sidewalk
and making as if to step upstairs each step he takes
and thinking he is climbing—in so far, just crazy,
that is all.</p>

<p>It would be much better in some ways for a husband
of this type to renounce love episodes forever,
for such actions form no part of a real one; they
are as productive as half a pair of scissors without
the other half.</p>

<p>This solitary vice in a husband (masturbatio per
vaginam) always comes from his hallucinating the
effects he should produce instead of producing them.
He is alone with his wife in his sexual (not love)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
episodes because she is practically not there. He
may never have thought of the question as to
where she may have been. She may have been
mentally in the arms of another man. “With another
person and yet alone!” is a terrible thought.</p>

<p>Yet when we think about what we see and hear
among so-called humans we must realize how much
alone all except the very fewest are, alone because
they have not yet discovered the only method of not
being alone—the supernal communion of one man
and one woman. The few men who have learned
how to love, and the exactly equal number of women
whom they have taught, are the only persons in the
world who are not absolutely and completely as
alone as would be a solitary chemical atom in an
illimitable universe of space.</p>

<h3 id="section156">§ 156</h3>

<p>All the crowds and jams of people we see are
merely, for the most part, huddling together, as
an unconscious compensation for the sickening loneliness
they feel in their heart of hearts. We see
them in amusement parks, and in all places where
hordes of people congregate; and undoubtedly a
part of the impulse which moves them is their
unconscious solitude for which they get only consciously
perceptible consolation in the sight of each
other and rubbing of elbows and treading on each
other’s feet.</p>

<p>If one should ask if sex is the sole or major
motive in all this the answer would be, by no means,
if physical sex is all that is meant. The need is for
companionship which many followers of crowds, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
having the companionship furnished by the complete
love of a man or a woman, fancy they get from
the sight or elbow-touch of masses of people.</p>

<p>The deeply, profoundly, thoroughly married
couples are the only ones who have no need to fear
anything that comes from incompleteness. They
neither crave nor are averse to other people, but the
most fully mated never appreciate crowds very
highly. Into their own mystic circle of binary personality
they cannot take a third.</p>

<p>For these thirds there is no hope but to find each
his or her own complementary personality. The
women wait; for there is nothing else to do. They
cannot find by looking; they can only give themselves
the gaunt consolation of distracting their own
attention from love until they are found by the
proper men.</p>

<p>For in spite of the great popularity which George
Bernard Shaw gives to his ideas by putting them in
epigrammatic and striking literary form, the truth
is manifest to all who think straightforwardly and
do not believe in a statement simply because it is
paradoxical and therefore emphatic—the truth,
namely, that women are not the choosers but if
there is any choice they are the chosen, and are
themselves utterly helpless and must remain inactive.</p>

<p>They can try to attract men but the more they
try, the more will the erotically developed men unconsciously
and unerringly infer that there is some
weakness about them that necessitates this strenuous
attempt to compensate for it. The harder they
try to attract men, the more suspicious do the men
become, particularly those having any deep acumen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
As for the men being simply the helpless puppets
of a sex of sirens—it is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The world is made up of the unmarried, the
truly mated and those ill-assorted thirds whom ignorance
has left unhappy and helpless until knowledge
comes to the male partner.</p>

<h3 id="section157">§ 157</h3>

<p>Many of these third persons are the wives of
ignorant husbands who have hallucinated the fusion
which they have never made. The husband fancies,
perhaps, that the fusion can be effected by the wife;
that all he needs to do is to submit himself to the
wife as dispenser of delights and that by merely
having him she will glow and burn with the heat
necessary to fuse their two souls and make them
a whole instead of fragments. Delusion! Hallucination!</p>

<p>The child says to a stick, “This is a horse.” The
child husband says to himself, “This is my wife,”
whether he knows it to be a fact or not. And
curiously enough the child knows he is only fancying;
but the man, in thousands of instances, <em>does not
know it</em>.</p>

<p>This unconscious, and therefore almost irresistible,
tendency on the part of men to believe the
existence of what they wish is the main obstacle to
man’s control of the erotic situation. Based on
biological necessity, which in the merely instinctive
acts of animals secures the sexual reaction on the
part of the female, the unconscious phantasy still
persists in the human animal, the phantasy that the
erotic acme of the man causes that of the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
every time. But it is a phantasy in the majority of
civilized marriages and tragically enough it may be
the only flaw in some where congeniality and affection
are flawless.</p>

<p>The bridegroom has this definite task before him
to know his wife, for he can never know her before
marriage. His knowing is a process of perception,
the failure to perceive being a form of anesthesia
in himself. Adam knew his wife—the only good
he brought out of Paradise and fully compensating
for the loss of Paradise.</p>

<p>When he knows his bride he will know exactly
how much resistance he has to overcome in order
to develop her. She cannot tell him anything in
words, for no woman can know. Not even the
most experienced woman sexually can put into words
exactly what unconscious resistance she may have
to even a virgin-pure man.</p>

<p>The bride’s resistance is just as real a force as is
the gravity in a pile of stones. At the bottom of
that pile of stones his bride’s soul waits and he
has to remove them one by one; actions which take
as concrete an amount of psychic energy as if they
could be measured in foot-pounds or kilowatt hours.</p>

<h3 id="section158">§ 158</h3>

<p>The groom not only has to see what resistance
there is, but has to know that he must remove it all.
The bride herself has no more power or control
over these resistances than she would if she were
literally buried under tons of rock. She depends
entirely on his work to get at her soul. Will he
ecstatically embrace one of these stones that cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her up? Like the child calling a stick a horse, will
he say: “This stone is my wife. If I can believe
hard enough, she may change, in my eyes, into my
wife and I shall be spared the effort of releasing her
from the weight which now oppresses her. How
sweet and tender this stone is! How it throbs and
palpitates as I squeeze it tightly in my arms! There,
it has melted entirely. Dear wife!”</p>

<p>Insane? Yes. And the woman herself, alive and
breathing under the load of stone which antiquity
with more than bestial blindness, with infinitely
more than granite heartlessness and marble stupidity
has heaped upon her for centuries, is so deeply
buried that she cannot herself even direct her own
release. Dimly she hears her man apostrophizing
with love the outermost stone. Will he ever get
the sense to drop it, pick up one after the other of
those overwhelming <em>her</em>, and actually penetrate to
her and grasp her in his arms. Good heavens!
How can intelligence be conveyed to that imbecile?</p>

<p>Or instead of hearing her husband hallucinating
her release by means of rapturously caressing a stone
that holds her down, she may have the still more
poignant agony of hearing him make love to a
woman already released from her bonds by some
other man.</p>

<p>“Damnation inconceivable! Is he, my husband,
willing to take the woman whom other hands have
released, whom the work of other men has made
practically theirs, and whom he virtually steals, or
as a beggar accepts like a fruit skin from another’s
feast?</p>

<p>“Or is it,” the poor soul may think to herself,
“that really in my own true being, I am less attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
than the women whose weight of oppression so
many men have cheerfully lifted? What have I
done to make myself so unattractive? Must I curse
my parents, who have, besides, perhaps, helped to
entomb me alive under these stones?”</p>

<h3 id="section159">§ 159</h3>

<p>The situation in many marriages is not less tragic
than this. The husband in this case has either not
been able to see the obstacles that lie between him
and complete emotional fusion with his wife, or if
he has seen them, he has not thought himself able
to remove them. In either case he may be more
ignorant than to blame; but not after he once gets
the point of view of this book.</p>

<p>His accomplishment, the only virile accomplishment
in the world, is plainly before him. He must
acquaint himself with the exact amount of resistance
and repression; and he must remove it piece by
piece if it takes a half a century. He must realize
fully that it is a piece of constructive work, and that
no one else can do it for him.</p>

<h3 id="section160">§ 160</h3>

<p>The anesthesia of the husband and the failure to
come up to the constant test are both increased by
man’s ignorance of the fundamental biological nature
of the woman.</p>

<p>The only remedy for it, which will improve the
conditions of marriage and reduce to the minimum
infidelity of wives and of husbands as well, is the
husband’s deeper knowledge of the feminine element.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
This knowledge, which should be an essential part
of a man’s education, cannot be entirely given him
by another, but must be the result of his own
observation.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the intimate adaptations required
of each marriage are absolutely individual.
While all women and all men are actuated by similar
unconscious motives, the specific working out of
these motives results in an interplay of forces which
is different in each individual marriage. There are
over a thousand types of this intimate interplay of
personalities within the marital state; also the types
change in special cases from time to time. It is easy
to see, therefore, that the minutiæ or marital living
have endless combinations of possibilities, concerning
which the husband would do well to become as
well informed as possible.</p>

<h3 id="section161">§ 161</h3>

<p>The hasty husband takes his own motions and
his own erotic acme, which are but parts, for the
whole. He takes the most physical aspect for the
love episode. Naming the part for the whole is a
sort of metonymy, which is a figure of speech and
not literal truth. The hasty husband is in this
sense unconsciously a liar. He cannot tell the truth
because he cannot know it. If we say that this
fragmentary performance of his is taken by him
to be logically or intellectually like the whole, we
must say that he rates low in discrimination. He
ought to know that the fragment is no more like
the whole thing than a hand is like the body.</p>

<p>Giving the physical side of the love episode too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
great a value is like connecting it too closely with
the imagination, or with that part of the imagination
that is bound up with the emotions. The factor
in the sex life of most of the animal-like humans,
that is, most closely connected with the strongest
emotions, is the acme. In true human love, then, the
strongest emotions are reassociated with other
elements of the love episode than the acme. And
the acme is the greatest desideratum only from the
unconscious or instinctive point of view.</p>

<p>The imagination, the power of visualizing (and
other forms of representations as well) then involves
the power to affect, or to effect changes in
the somatic reactions of the husband that render
possible the prolongation of a sex act, and its transformation,
into a love episode. The imagination
of organic sensations in himself, in the normal husband,
retards the progress of the love episode for
the benefit of the wife. The hasty husband lacks
just this imagination and the love episode is hurried
through in the manner of an animal sex act.</p>

<p>The husband who reaches his acme of erotic
relaxation even before actual contact with his love
object has not in consciousness dwelt much upon the
numerous preliminaries. Methods of retardation
are methods of admitting into consciousness the
different innate associations between emotions and
the touch and movement sensations constituting the
first stages.</p>

<h3 id="section162">§ 162</h3>

<p>The use of the imagination as a transformer of
unconscious energy is a comparatively modern technique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and one made use of with great effect in autosuggestion.</p>

<p>As a transformer of unconscious psychic energy,
or possibly, better, a re-shaper, it has sharply to be
distinguished from phantasy.</p>

<p>Phantasy is the continuous mental activity that
goes on night and day in the mind of every man,
woman and child. It consists of visual images,
auditory images, tactual, kinesthetic, thermal and
a dozen other qualities all combining with each other
in the patterns by no means fortuitous, but organized
into groups, some of which have been called
complexes. This organization is the unconscious
wish. The patterns formed are unrelated to time,
are unmoral and follow exclusively the pleasure-pain
principle.</p>

<p>Phantasy, which is entirely spontaneous, or independent
of any conscious volition on the part of the
individual, is about ninety-nine per cent submerged
in the unconscious. The one per cent more or less
that emerges into the consciousness of the ordinary
man of the world comes in as day-dreaming or as
dreams of the night. In these two forms it appears
in a shape least disguised, and is therefore the chief
material of psychoanalysis, which is an inventory
of the contents of the unconscious of the individual,
an inventory that shows what possibilities he has
of future better adaptation to his environment. It
also shows why the people who are ill-adapted have
failed to adapt themselves.</p>

<p>We are obliged to assume a causal connection
between the phantasies of unconscious mind and the
physiological process in the body on the one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and on the other the broader life currents of the
individual.</p>

<h3 id="section163">§ 163</h3>

<p>Only by assuming this causal connection, which
must also be a two-way connection, can we explain
any influence of mind upon body. From innumerable
instances, however, we are all absolutely sure
that the mind influences the bodily functions and
that the bodily functions influence the mind.</p>

<p>In no sphere of human activity is the influence
of the mind on the body more clearly demonstrable
than in the erotic sphere, both in its equatorial
physical zones and in its polar intellectual zones.</p>

<p>This makes it absolutely incontrovertible not only
that man can control his emotions, including the
erotic; but that he should, if he wishes to be human
and not merely animal.</p>

<p>In the causal connection between hypersomatic
(mind) and hyposomatic (body) there is at least
one link called the imagination. But the fact that
imagination is so broad a term makes the understanding
difficult as to how the various mental
mechanisms, mostly unconscious, interact with each
other.</p>

<p>The fact, however, is well known and admitted
by all scientists that the mind does influence the
body. It causes changes in the functions of the
bodily organs. A purely mental state caused by
external stimulation, for example, the hearing of
some bad news or witnessing of some tragic occurrence,
will alter the internal secretions of some of
the endocrine glands, postpone digestion or upset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it, accelerate circulation and respiration and cause
other changes.</p>

<p>Sex phenomena are no exception to this principle
that bodily processes are conditioned, that is, partially
caused, by mental processes. Sex cannot be a
part of love until love which is hypersomatic (mental)
is in control.</p>

<p>It would be exceedingly satisfactory if one could
devise a mental pattern for love that would apply
to all individuals; but the fact that the various
factors are over twenty in number, making over four
hundred combinations of only two at a time, render
it practically impossible to do more than make a
generic verbal formula such as “better and better
every day.”</p>

<p>It is impossible however, to get away from the
fact that the sense type of imagination has not a
little influence in the original rapport that springs
up between two persons of opposite sex. Obviously
a colour-blind man could not be much influenced by
the iridescent beauty of some young women. There
are people who are tone-deaf, and, to such, a monotonous
voice might not have the deterrent effect
it would for some. There are individual variations
in the sensitivity to every one of the twenty-odd
sense qualities that enter consciousness from time
to time. Any of these variations may play a part
in the first attraction exerted by young people on
each other.</p>

<h3 id="section164">§ 164</h3>

<p>Every one of these twenty-odd different qualities
of sense impression may enter consciousness from
time to time as a representation or reverberation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
an original sensation. The commonest of these is
sight. The appearance of some facial expression,
for example, of an attractive woman, will, spontaneously
recur to a young man for a long time. Motivated
by pleasurable emotions experienced at the
first sight, these visual memory images will recur
again and again, each time accompanied by, if not
caused by, the continuance or reëmergence of the
pleasurable emotions.</p>

<p>But visual images are not the only ones that
spontaneously recur. If the individual belongs to
the auditory type, there will be numerous auditory
“images.” He will hear in his mind’s ear the
joyous timbre of a woman’s voice, also perhaps
motivated by the same recurrent pleasurable emotion
he experienced when listening to it the first
time.</p>

<p>Visual and auditory “images” or representations
may be supplemented by those of any of the other
twenty-odd qualities of sense impression. The
memory of a dance recalls a number of these,
tactual, olfactory, kinesthetic, mostly, however, in
the average person, not clearly conscious.</p>

<p>People have to be taught to see what is before
their eyes. They also have to be taught to recognize
timbres of musical instruments, intervals
between tones, composition of various chords, etc.</p>

<p>Conscious attention must be used to enable some
people to recognize the difference between various
flavours, perfumes, odours, bouquets of wine, etc.</p>

<p>This sharpening of sense discrimination is accomplished
by means of the conscious attention to the
various images.</p>

<p>The sharpening of sense discrimination with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
assistance of the mental standard supplied by the
various representations of former sense impressions
involves a change in the sense organ itself if we
include in the organ, as we must, its nerve connections
with the brain and with other organs.</p>

<h3 id="section165">§ 165</h3>

<p>This is how we may conceive the effect of mind
upon body. The imagination, composed of its
various qualities of images visual, auditory and
other, involves the change in the sense organ and
in the brain and the other organs connected. We
are thus being changed continually, both body and
mind, by impressions coming from without and by
the reverberations of these impressions that are
known as mental images.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the drama, and lately the
moving picture, is recognized as one of the deepest
transmuting influences in human life?</p>

<h3 id="section166">§ 166</h3>

<p>Every sense impression is a suggestion. It is a
psychological axiom that every idea tends to work
itself out into an act on the part of the person that
accepts the idea. This is the basis of hypnotism and
any form of non-hypnotic suggestion.</p>

<p>It is evident then, that the sense impressions received
every second of our waking life (together
with the images or reverberations of these impressions
that continue to live in the unconscious and
appear only occasionally in consciousness) accumulate
suggestive force. It is evident that every
individual is subjected from birth to a continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
stream of suggestions, some of which he accepts
(among them the most often repeated ones).</p>

<p>If these suggestions are formed of images (conscious
or unconscious) of health, happiness and
triumphant activity, they will be accepted and constitute
a pattern for the entire life activity of this
individual. And the same is true <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The impressions thus received constitute the content
of the imagination and this content produces
either well-being or ill-being (not to say illness) in
the individual so influenced.</p>

<h3 id="section167">§ 167</h3>

<p>The inference that a wholesome erotic pattern
must be provided for young people, and adopted
by older married persons, is therefore irresistible.</p>

<p><em>The only way actions of any kind can be
made better is by introducing into the mind a pattern
according to which these actions are to be
carried out.</em> The only means for introducing this
pattern into the mind of a man, if he does not
already possess it, is by way of the imagination.
The various visual, auditory and other images must
be created in the mind of the individual before it
will be physically possible for him to follow this
pattern.</p>

<p>Mere verbal reiteration of a clumsily worded
command or prohibition <em>never</em> provides the imaginative
factor which is the essential one. Prohibitions
are discussed elsewhere (<a href="#section197">§ 197</a>).</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the imagination is the vital
factor in any action just because it constitutes the
pattern of the action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>It is always much better psychologically to show
or describe a person doing what one desires him to
do than in abstract terms, to tell him to do it.</p>

<h3 id="section168">§ 168</h3>

<p>Therefore a love pattern is needed. It is needed
by the husband in order that he may control the
erotic situation. It is not needed by the wife in
order that she may control, for in the erotic sphere
control is not hers nor does she want it; but it is
needed by her in order to know whether or not she
is being properly controlled erotically.</p>

<p>As no two individuals are alike, this makes it
evident that the function of the husband necessary
to create a happy marriage is to emphasize the
mental (or hypersomatic) side of it, for the purpose
of including every physical aspect in the most comprehensive
way.</p>

<p>Again it must be reiterated that instinct alone
can never <em>guarantee</em> a successful married life. The
erotologist knows full well that the husband, relying
on instinct alone, remains unutterably selfish, and
therefore anesthetic, in thousands of cases; and that
he can, if he has the confidence of knowledge, make
of his wife a whole wife and not, as in the majority
of cases a fragmentary wife.</p>

<p>A man should not let his wife remain fragmentary.
He should not be content with either the domestic-servant
fragment or the cook fragment, nor
should he regard her solely as washwoman, stenographer
or performer of any other essentially egoistic-social
function. “Wife” should be restored to
its original Anglo-Saxon concept of “the trembler,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
i.e., the thrilled woman. Many men on the contrary
speak of “the” wife, exactly as they would say “the”
cook, or “the” chambermaid.</p>

<p>Instinct alone, which is purely selfish, in spite of
its occasional marvellous faculty of providing for
the future of others, can in almost none of the intimate
marital relations insure a continuance of completely
satisfactory love episodes. Continuance of
these alone cements married love and furnishes the
foundation for a truly artistic erotic superstructure—a
love mansion, having a beauty far surpassing
the lust hovels in which, after their tinsel and gingerbread
honeymoon cottages, the average married pair
spend the remainder of their lives.</p>

<h3 id="section169">§ 169</h3>

<p>If, as assumed broadly above, the remedy for the
ills which beset the married life which is guided
by instinct alone are more excitement for the woman
and less for the man, this only in one way suggests
a balance which (as many wives consciously or unconsciously
perceive) grows less and less as the
years go on.</p>

<p>The man advances in his profession, makes more
money, gains more or less gratifying triumphs in
the world of affairs, joins a club or lodge, meets
and has more or less stimulating contacts with more
and more of his fellow-men. His wife the while
remains mostly in the home, is restricted by the
necessity of care of children, if any. If there are
no children, she is generally steered by her husband
into the least stimulating life possible, for he knows
unconsciously that the interest of his wife in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
people is mildly displeasing to him. He wishes to
own her all—her actions, her thoughts. If he
does not someone else will, and she will be, to that
extent, not his. It will be difficult for him to reason
that this type of ownership is merely the gratification
of an egoistic-social instinct. If there is one
thing a man should not, for his own erotic interests,
want to do, that thing is the establishing of an
ownership or possession. Ownership of wives dates
back at least to the early Roman times when one
had to own and control one’s wife’s whereabouts in
order to satisfy oneself, and one’s neighbours, that
one’s freeborn children were one’s own.</p>

<p>As a gratification of the egoistic-social instinct,
ownership of the wife’s person, property, actions
and thoughts is in direct antagonism with pure love
instinct, which controls most satisfactorily and
gratefully when there is no egoistic-social compulsion
acting through husband on wife. Pure love
instinct is gratified only when the control is perfected
by eliminating all egoistic-social motives of
husband or wife from the situation.</p>

<p>This is realized by some young women who marry
but insist that they be not supported by their
husbands.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNHAPPY MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<h3 id="section170">§ 170</h3>

<p>Those who marry from merely physical sexual
motives, who overemphasize or overweight the
physical side of sex, are not able to gain from
marriage what the rationally controlled love episode
can give them. They naturally never admit that
this is the case. They frequently do not know it
themselves.</p>

<p>They think perhaps that they are putting the
love instinct ahead of the egoistic-social, but their
knowledge of men, women and things is defective.</p>

<p>They are to a certain degree anesthetic in the
etymological sense, because they do not know how
to live most fully. They are in a position similar
to a child who should find a package of new thousand-dollar
bills, and take them out into the street
and play with them. They are infantile in appreciation
of values, which, however, they may later
learn.</p>

<p>To overweight the physical factor in the love
between the sexes and to place the love motive
ahead of the egoistic-social motive are not by any
means the same thing. It has been already indicated
that the overweighting of the physical factor
proceeds from an egoistic motive, and is thereby
vitiated as a truly human motive in the highest
sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Both parties to such a marriage can, if they see
and understand, change so as to raise the level of
their own motive and give the true love motive its
real place, as might be illustrated by the case of a
young man who marries a woman author twenty
years older than himself, motivated at first solely
by the glamour of her reputation; but, finding in
her a great heart and womanly qualities he had not
before suspected, becomes her true mate in every
sense; or the girl who, dazzled by the wealth of a
suitor old enough to be her father but rich enough
to “buy and sell” her father several times over,
finally discovers in him a completeness and fullness
of love that quite satisfies her when she realizes
that, in spite of his egoistic instincts that have made
him rich his love instinct is still richer. All that is
necessary in a match “misgrafféd in respect of years”
is the proper subordination by both partners of the
egoistic-social to the love instinct.</p>

<h3 id="section171">§ 171</h3>

<p>Unconsciously, of course, such people know from
the first that they should get from each other the
sweetness par excellence of human life, but while
they know this unconsciously and it makes some of
them uncomfortable and eccentric, even unhuman,
they fancy so many inhibitions and barriers to it
(particularly in the case of narrowly brought up
women) that they do not gain from marriage that
unspeakable and indescribable sense of identity
each with the other that would successfully obviate
any tendency whatever to infidelity.</p>

<p>This feeling of identity is not only thus physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in the husband and wife at the climax of erotism,
but is given tangible, visible, and in all ways perceptible,
manifestation in their children. It is given
ideal existence in the community of interests it
engenders in connection with the family life, interests
which are here the expression of the ego-instinct,
but here, as they should be, interests arising from
the subordination of the ego-instinct to the now
brightly revealed love instincts, which are not accessible
to consciousness until after enlightenment in
the technique of the love drama.</p>

<p>Those people also are unable to give fullest expression
to themselves in the love episode who consciously
or unconsciously, frankly or otherwise, place
the egoistic-social motive above the love motive,
who marry “for a meal ticket” or for any other
egoistic-social motive such as wealth or position.</p>

<p>Both of these may be taught, if they can be made
to see their false positions. Those who overweight
the physical motive can, unless their intelligence is
of too low an order, be made to see eventually, that
they are contenting themselves, or trying to make
themselves content, with much less happiness than
they are capable of. Those who overemphasize the
egoistic-social end of their relation to their spouses,
can be instructed in love, so that they can raise their
union to the higher order, unless, of course, there is
the comparatively rare absolute incompatibility of
temperament.</p>

<p>Marriage need not in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred be dissolved. Within reasonable limits;
that is, excluding the widest possible divergence of
taste and interests, almost any man can learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
control the erotism of almost any woman, if he
wishes to take the trouble to learn how to do it.</p>

<h3 id="section172">§ 172</h3>

<p>Most emphatically this does not mean that the
control here referred to is all there is to a perfect
marriage. It has been reiterated that the erotic
control is only the foundation, but important as all
foundations are. The erotic control leads not only
to the maximum egoistic-social freedom, but to the
greatest possible development of each of the partners’
distinctive personality.</p>

<p>The love confidence gained by the establishment
of the one-way control in the erotic sphere only
opens the windows of the house of love to the invigorating
air of the outdoor world.</p>

<p>The unhappily married are unhappy because each
is watching the other continually, devoting to this
conscious and unconscious surveillance so much
energy that either they have none left for the development
of the properly subordinated egoistic-social
interests or they lose so much energy in the unconscious
conflict that they tend to become neurotic.</p>

<p>The unhappy married ones’ lack of love confidence
is the most deeply gnawing care known to
human misery. No egoistic-social interest of either
but is regarded by the other as drawing him or her
away.</p>

<h3 id="section173">§ 173</h3>

<p>The marriage of two young people need not be
postponed over a month or two after they have
learned enough of each other to be sure that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are placing each motive, the love motive and the
egoistic-social motive, in the proper relations to the
other; namely, that the egoistic motive is recognized
as being of less value toward their happiness. No
fears should be allowed to enter their minds about
the happiness of their marriage. Birth control
should prevent any fear from the egoistic-economic
point of view.</p>

<h3 id="section174">§ 174</h3>

<p>If it should seem to some that the potentialities
of the marriage that has been called a lottery are
usually those of misery, and that the ordinary marriage
only brings out the miseries of existence to
which some shut their eyes, and from which others
run away, it need only be suggested that almost
nothing runs itself in the world as we know it, but
everything needs constant upkeep, and it would be
unreasonable to expect that when the nuptial knot
is tied all activities in the direction of keeping it
tied could be given up.</p>

<p>If the world about us is in constant change, to
which we are obliged to make constantly changing
adaptation, it is even more strikingly a fact that
the world within us is constantly changing; and
that we need to control this change ourselves and
could not, if we tried, find a more fascinating occupation
than learning how to make our inner adaptations
in the best manner.</p>

<p>Marriages that run down before death has ended
them are those where the man has lost his psychic
potence, due to initial or gradually developing
anesthesia on his part.</p>

<p>In the courtship he has taken a man’s part, presumably;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
but has stopped his wooing after marriage,
because he has confused egoistic-social impulses with
erotic. He has thought marriage was a civil contract
by which he came into possession of something.
Love scorns contracts; as it evaporates in barter.
Most unhappy marriages are of the “run-down”
type. The thesis of this book is that the only distinctive
man’s work in the world is to keep winding
them up. The man that lets his marriage run down
is probably a perpetual-motion crank at heart. He
thinks that in marriage he has found a thing that
will run by itself forever.</p>

<h3 id="section175">§ 175</h3>

<p>A passionate desire for culmination represents
well the attitude of the executive head, or man of
affairs who advances business by delegating details
to others. There is no detail of the behaviour of
the truly mated that the husband can want to be
delegated to underlings. Love is not a business and
no part of it should be either left undone or delegated
to another man; though there are many husbands
who apparently think some of the preliminaries
can be omitted. Possibly the hasty husbands
have thought that only the “high spots” of love
could be or should be touched by them, because their
business or professional lives do not permit them to
look into every detail, much less do it themselves.
But the minutiæ of love are like the notes of a
violin score; they all have to be played by the
violinist and they are all given their due effect and
proper shading by the true artist.</p>

<p>Possibly one may say that all men cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
virtuosos in love, particularly as it is infinitely more
complicated than even the musical art; but at any
rate all can use their utmost endeavour in the performances
of the duets, which constitute the most
valuable works of art for the family and the nation.</p>

<h3 id="section176">§ 176</h3>

<p>The unconscious polyandry of the average married
woman is absolutely proved if she does not
regard her husband as satisfying in every way. If
there is the remotest doubt of this, if she has the
slightest repulsion or disinclination or aversion to
any feature, act, mannerism or personal quality of
his, she is withholding from him, possibly blamelessly
because unconsciously, a feeling which, as she
cannot give it to him, she must and does unwittingly
give to some other man either seen or dreamed of.
Absolute surrender on her part to one man is essential
for a strictly monogamous union, a complete
union entirely excluding the appeal of every other
man under the sun. Any reserve whatever on her
part is a reserve that will be kept by the unconscious
part of her solely for the use not of her husband but
of some other man possibly not yet seen by her;
later she may meet him.</p>

<p>How can a woman give herself, if she has keen
sense discrimination, to a man who isn’t strong,
isn’t clean, isn’t well-dressed, isn’t generous and
loving? If she has this fine discrimination she will
not run the risk of approaching a marriage with
such a man. If a man of undeniable strength (mental,
not physical) makes love to her, his sincerity
and the strength of his desire will enable her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
change other characteristics in him before marriage.</p>

<h3 id="section177">§ 177</h3>

<p>There is, as Krafft-Ebing argues, a natural
“sexual subjection” of woman (i.e., “women are
naturally masochistic”). Saying that the essence
of femininity is to be erotically led, does not mean
that women are naturally masochistic. In no sense
does being led, in the purely erotic or love impulse
aspect of the marital relation, imply masochism.
Only, however, when the ego impulse is so strong as
to need much sacrifice in the love episode can really
masochistic feelings occur in the wife; and in the
husband only when he uses the love episode as an
egoistic act, by which he is to compete with other
men in the favour of his wife.</p>

<p>If that jealous stage occur, it is a condition where
the full expression of the love instinct itself is
diminished in favour of the other. The even momentary
thought that his wife could be given a
more thorough relaxation in the purely erotic sphere
by another than himself, a more perfect consummation
than perfection itself, which he has induced in
her, is a thought that is in itself masochistic and
least likely to occur to either of a thoroughly married
pair.</p>

<p>The idea of masochism as an element in marriage
is worthy of consideration only because it is the
ruling motive of the wife in those unions where the
husband has not assumed control of the emotional
situation and the wife has been so well trained in
the Christian duty of self-sacrifice as to believe that
she must suffer—truly a humiliating thought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the husband if he happens to be a man. He thus
vicariously suffers from his own ignorance.</p>

<p>Masochism, the tendency to gain pleasure from
the pain another inflicts on oneself, is a natural
phenomenon at a certain stage of pre-synthetic
childish erotic development; and, in all normally
developed persons, is outgrown. Indeed, a woman,—and
<i lang="la">a fortiori</i>, a man, who retains any great masochistic
element in his love life—is, in that respect
alone, a child and not an adult, and incapable of
adult love until that tendency is removed.</p>

<p>But it persists more frequently in women, and
constitutes a part of the sexual inhibition already
referred to. It is a tendency about which all young
husbands should be warned in advance. They are
not to allow their wives for an instant to have any
reason to infer that the wife’s marital “duty” is to
sacrifice herself or any part of herself to the physical
or mental pleasure of her husband. The eradication
of this idea can be begun by the man long
before engagement, in spheres of activity quite far
from the sexual, and should be steadily and consistently
carried on. He should never ask her to do
anything “for him,” especially not anything to which
she may have expressed any unwillingness, not to
say repugnance, herself. He should see to it that
he gets his pleasure from the knowledge that what he
does is most likely to be gratifying to her. This
is, of course, the attitude of the real man.</p>

<p>A girl should be instructed enough not to be
impressed by the mental autoerotism of “lounge
lizards” who are feeding their own erotic phantasies
by sight and touch of her. They are more
than likely to become mentally autoerotic husbands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>While on the topic of masochism it is necessary
to warn all young women that in no sense is self-sacrifice
the object of a healthy marriage. The
self-sacrifice which is so lauded in theologies is a
sacrifice of egoistic impulse gratification. In the face
of a great erotic exaltation there can be no such thing
as a thought of sacrifice. No woman really in love
can perceive anything but gain in really erotic action,
for if she knows herself she realizes that her strongest
impulses are those of Eros.</p>

<h3 id="section178">§ 178</h3>

<p>Any conflict in her psyche is between the erotic
and the egoistic-social impulses. The only inhibitions
against the erotic impulses, as everywhere,
appear to be the egoistic-social ones, though it has
been pointed out that even the erotic instinct itself
contains an innate antithesis that might cause a
conflict even were the egoistic-social influences minimized
or even removed.</p>

<p>One suspects that in the woman these unconscious
doubts must come primarily from not having been
completely controlled, so completely in the erotic
sphere that no egoistic-social impulses are for the
time perceptible. A woman of a highly refined nature
whose husband’s erotic control is not forceful
enough thus to expunge totally all egoistic-social
impulses for the time being, will have a certain
number of them not disposed of.</p>

<p>It thus happens that such a married woman, when
loved by another than her husband and yielding to
him, will in so doing obliterate even this residue of
egoistic-social inhibitions. This explains why an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
illicit love is to them so powerful a stimulus. They
observe a sudden separation of the two spheres of
impulse in themselves, and they realize the illimitable
enhancement of the erotic motive over the
egoistic-social, the latter naturally appearing as
dross against the gold of the erotic. If in the
clandestine love they have swept away all egoistic-social
conventions, they have practically rendered
themselves subject to erotic impulses alone. Thus
the very fact of this love being illicit appears to
render it purely erotic, absolute, all-comprehensive,
the conflict settled beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="section179">§ 179</h3>

<p>Freud in his paper on the love life already referred
to<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> makes the observation that there is a
type of “love” in a certain class of men in which
the man seems to prefer as his loved one a woman
who is at least nominally possessed by another man.
His attentions to her are carried on as if he were
rescuing her from some oppressor. In extreme
instances he often professes to be solicitous for her
virtue, which consists in his eyes only in not being
used by the other man. Freud continues that the
other man from whom this type of lover wishes to
rescue the woman represents this lover’s own
father, the woman his mother, and he himself is
the little boy in the original family triangle where
the son, according to Freud, is always jealous of
the father and continually trying to get his mother
away from the father. The “love” type here described
is another instance of the compulsion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
repeat, referred to in his book <cite>Beyond the Pleasure
Principle</cite>.</p>

<p>It should be the privilege of the husband to sweep
away all egoistic-social inhibitions. He should see
to it that his actions throughout his married life
are such that his wife makes to him the total surrender
here implied. If he does not, he has not
taken all the steps he might, to render his marriage
absolutely happy.</p>

<h3 id="section180">§ 180</h3>

<p>It is likely that the woman who responds thus
erotically to the illicit love situation, because love is
thus cleared of all egoistic-social inhibitions, may be
the counterpart of the man just described. If he
wishes to rescue her from a personality, apparently
her husband, but in reality the father influence
(from the point of view of the lover), so she may
wish to be rescued, i.e., removed from all influence
of authority—the father influence in her own personality.
For in the unconscious the father factor
represents the egoistic-social impulses. It is the
father who requires compliance with egoistic-social
demands. And whoever can sweep away all these
influences symbolically rescues her from her own
father. It should be, and in many cases indeed is,
the husband that does this; and if he does it completely
there is no motive for illicit love.</p>

<p>In no sense can the so-called sacrifice made by a
woman of these egoistic-social demands be regarded
as a masochistic self-sacrifice involving any erotic
factor. The erotic is not sacrificed but magnified.
The misfortune is only that in some cases the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
does not cause the sacrifice which then is left
for some other man to bring about.</p>

<p>Without for a moment implying that this illicit
love on the woman’s part has any more ethical value
than the man’s attempted rescue, it is impossible not
to believe that the periodical abolition by the husband
of all egoistic-social inhibitions of his wife
is a purification of the erotic factor. Taking place
within the marital state and effected solely by the
husband, this makes the light of love burn so much
more brightly as to illumine every other life activity.</p>

<h3 id="section181">§ 181</h3>

<p>Jealousy is treated by Ellis in a vein apparently
unaware of the contribution made to this subject by
Freud, who shows that the man is jealous because
he is either physically or psychically impotent. If
the husband either knows or thinks that he is unable
to lift his wife into the empyrean, the thought inevitably
comes to him that there must be some other
man who can do it. If this thought is an unconscious
one it is manifested in every restrictive measure
taken to prevent his wife from meeting other men,
for which measures he assigns not the real cause,
for he does not know it, but all sorts of reasons
developing through the unconscious mechanism of
rationalization, either that she is not attending to
her duty, or neglecting him and his interests or
spending too much money, or what not. This condition
of jealousy is all the more likely to exist in
the husbands who are so ignorant of love that they
are unaware that there is any such thing as the
woman’s acme of pleasure in the love episode. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
form of jealousy, primarily due to the husband’s
ignorance, is all the more painful to him because
he does not understand, and all the more tragic
in its irony.</p>

<p>It seems, too, quite probable that part of the
jealousy of women is due to a corresponding situation
of their own erotic life. A woman who fails
to apperceive in consciousness the overwhelming
somatic reactions which occur at the climax of the
love episode is in a condition quite analogous to that
of psychic impotence in man. If man’s jealousy, as
has been shown by psychoanalysis, is really caused
by his psychic impotence, i.e., his anesthesia, woman’s
jealousy is evidently also caused by her anesthesia
which is a form of psychic impotence.</p>

<h3 id="section182">§ 182</h3>

<p>The case cited by Ellis (that of Mrs. Samuel
Pepys, as recounted in the famous diary) contains
only the man’s side. Possibly if the lady’s side
were known it would be found that she was herself
deficient in love and that she dreaded her husband’s
possibly finding a woman who could react toward
him in a more complete and satisfactory way than
she could herself, this entirely apart from the question
whether or not it should be the duty of the
man to evoke such a response. She would feel
unhappy and all the more conscious if she knew it
was his duty and that he had fled from her to others
where perhaps the task would be easier.</p>

<p>It is also insignificant that Pepys himself records:
“I must here remark that I have lain with my
moher (wife) as a husband more times since this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
falling out than in, I believe, twelve months before,
and with more pleasure to her than in all the time
of our marriage before.” This cannot be adduced
as a proof that the jealousy aroused in the wife was
the cause of any improvement in the marital relations
of the Pepyses, but that his noting an increase
in her pleasure simply indicates that because of his
own lack of imagination he had not been playing
the husband’s part for the preceding twelvemonth
as he should have. His own imagination was probably
stirred by “Deb’s” propinquity; as it would
not have been had his erotic life with his wife been
on the high passional level it should. This is the
only reason why a little jealousy is supposed to
whet the edge of love. If Pepys had been grounded
in true love instead of a small-minded man, flinging
notes to his wife’s maid, advising her to help him
out in the lie he told his wife, he would not have
failed so to control his wife’s erotic emotions that
she would have outshone any other woman in attractiveness.</p>

<h3 id="section183">§ 183</h3>

<p>Furthermore Ellis admits, and quotes his authorities
to show, that jealousy is “an emotion which is
at its maximum among animals, among savages,
among children, in the senile, in the degenerate, and
very specially in chronic alcoholics.” He notes that
the supreme artists and masters of the human
heart, who have most consummately represented the
tragedy of jealousy, clearly recognized that it is
either atavistic or pathological. Shakespeare made
his Othello a barbarian, and Tolstoy made the
Pozdnischeff of his <cite>Kreutzer Sonata</cite> a lunatic. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the jealous person is above all (at least psychically)
impotent and projects, on the most likely object, his
own desires, which he cannot fulfill for himself.</p>

<p>Let every jealous husband ponder this. If he
cannot utterly satisfy his wife erotically, he is jealous
of other men simply because consciously or unconsciously
he thinks some other man can. Also
if he cannot, his inability probably proceeds either
from ignorance of the art of love or from a foolish
disbelief in his physical powers, a most common
delusion in the ordinary man who is brought up
in the tradition that sex activity involves a loss of
vitality, instead of constituting, as it does, an exercise
of the interstitial glands, whose functioning is
necessary to the most robust health and success,
both of which are inimical to or destructive of the
emotion of jealousy.</p>

<h3 id="section184">§ 184</h3>

<p>One of the factors that make marriage a lottery
for those who cannot or do not know about the
unconscious element in the marital situation is the
unconscious homosexuality characterizing so many
men and women.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that the only impossible
women, psychically, are those who have this unsuspected
homosexual trend. It is an absolutely
proven fact that the men who have it strongly developed
are themselves impossible, unless they are
cured of it.</p>

<p>The subject of homosexuality is one of the most
serious, most complicated and most difficult ones of
all the subjects connected with the marital question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Let it not be understood that the homosexuals
are all manifestly woman-hating men or man-hating
women. Their homosexuality is not as evident as
that. Sometimes its only visible sign is being what
is called a man’s man or a woman’s woman.</p>

<p>The man who enjoys men’s company almost exclusively,
the club man, the man who never misses
an opportunity to meet men, who invariably rides
in the smoker but who does not invariably smoke
there, who is much more at ease with men than
with women, is in all these reactions motivated
not solely by the conscious motive of carrying on
so-called male activities, but partly by an unconscious
homosexual tendency which, though it may
never express itself in overt acts, is still an influence
dominating the majority of his actions, and, to that
extent, is an influence working against his completely
hologamous status. It is, in some if not all cases,
undoubtedly the factor that is most powerful in
preventing him from obtaining the erotic control
over his wife necessary to a perfect hologamy.</p>

<p>Our man-made civilization has strongly homosexual
tendencies, and has had them for centuries,
expressed not only in men’s (and women’s) clubs,
associations, fraternities and secret societies, but
also in the compensatory woman-hunting and
woman-worshipping done by some of the individual
men, as a reaction from the unconsciously perceived
homosexuality of their environment.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis has shown, indeed, that some of
the illicit sex relationships maintained by men are
mostly for the purpose of demonstrating to the men
themselves, bachelor club men, for example, that
they are not really homosexually inclined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychoanalysis also shows the close connection
of this deficient masculinity with jealousy on the
one hand, and with paranoia on the other. Also it
has been shown that morbid jealousy in woman has
sometimes the same cause. “The root of this jealousy
is a non-conscious homosexuality. She is jealous
of her woman friend, because she herself is in
love with the friend. She puts herself in the rôle
of the man.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From these considerations it will be evident that
the man or woman with the unconscious homosexual
trend cannot be a true mate until the trend is redirected.
The obverse of this is also quite suggestive,
although not necessarily operative in all instances;
namely, that, if the passion for his wife
cools, it <em>may</em> be because he has, or has developed, in
himself a homosexual tendency of which he is unconscious.</p>

<h3 id="section185">§ 185</h3>

<p>A careful distinction needs here to be made between
the sex activity that is really erotic—that
of two perfectly mated lovers—and that which does
not rise above the hyposomatic (physical) level.
This latter invariably, except in the most unintelligent
and spiritually undeveloped of humans, contains
a conflict which may or may not enter consciousness.
There is in people highly civilized according to
puritanical ideals always a conscious conflict between
the physical expression of love and their traditional
ideas that the body is base and ignoble and
the soul is a thing separate from the body and superior
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychoanalytic research into the unconscious
shows that there in the levels below, and inaccessible
to consciousness, the conflicts that like a perpetual
tug of war are uselessly consuming large
amounts of psychic energy are also, in that shunting
of energy from its natural destination to other
termini which may be practically any of the organs
of the body, causing a derangement that if long
continued easily becomes a functional disease.</p>

<p>The conflict that is conscious also produces a
physiological derangement that may become a disorder.
So in either case, whether the conflict be
conscious or unconscious, the physiological processes
are more or less disturbed.</p>

<p>If, as sometimes happens, a man’s inhibitions are
too great, he is absolutely unable even to begin
to have a love episode. If they are less great, he
may be able to begin it but not to continue it. If
there is any inhibition at all his part in the love
episode is affected by just that amount of psychic
energy that represents the force of his inhibition.</p>

<p>The conflict that is expressed in physical derangement,
disorder, malaise or any other unpleasant
result is almost always a mental conflict that can
be resolved by mental means better than by physical.</p>

<p>In sex activity that is truly erotic there is no
conflict in the man and none in the woman. It may
be said that sex activity never becomes truly erotic
until these conflicts have subsided.</p>

<p>But in the unhappy marriage a part of the conflict
on the husband’s part comes from his unconscious
realization that he has not assumed the truly
masculine rôle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section186">§ 186</h3>

<p>A brief résumé will be now given of conclusions
so far reached. Man’s control, while difficult for
him to gain and particularly in the love episode,
is yet essential to his perfect union with his mate,
unless there is proved to be, which has not yet been
done, a congenitally uncontrollable type of men.
Such men could never satisfy any except women
who are erotically the most highly developed, in the
sense that anything or nothing would send them
into transports—a comparatively rare type of
woman.</p>

<p>Haste on the man’s part in the love episode, his
acknowledged precipitateness, his hurry to relax
sexual tension, is due directly to his own anesthesia,
his insensibility to the preliminary reactions of his
mate, and in some cases a total ignorance of the
existence of her final reaction. He does not know
what effect in his mate he should really strive to get.</p>

<p>A knowledge of that effect involves a recognition
of the fact that all women are unconsciously trying
continually to test the man’s psychical strength.
Many actions of women cannot be accounted for
except by assuming this unconscious motive, for
which, of course, there is a biological cause in the
attempt of nature to mate the woman with the
strongest man. The congenitally uncontrollable (if
any exists) man will go down under this test, uniformly.</p>

<p>This biological cause produces in the woman the
tendency to dissemble. This tendency makes the
woman coy, bashful, modest, reserved, retiring. As
animal she is always facing away from the male in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the sexual act and as Ellis has noted, only the
human female has in the human love episode turned
so as to face the man. But this subhuman characteristic
is always present in the woman, manifesting
itself in some of her actions if not in all, and constitutes
an obstacle to the man’s self-control; for,
unless he has insight enough into the feminine character
to discount her dramatic prevarications, he
will infer that it is useless and hopeless for him to
try to produce any effect whatever in her, so he
might as well produce what effect he can—namely,
in himself. He does not know that the most satisfactory
result in his own feelings is produced by
the reactions which he effects in her, through the
reservation of his own supreme reaction until she
is past knowing it herself, until, therefore, he has
convinced her that his control is greater than hers,
that his strength is greater.</p>

<p>As it is evident that in animal copulation whatever
acme is reached is reached simultaneously by
both sexes, because of the briefness of the act, it
is reasonable to suppose that the man’s unconscious
situation contains the implication that his own erotic
acme necessarily involves the woman’s. In other
words every man has an unconscious phantasy that
when he has completely satisfied himself his mate
is completely satisfied. Only after years of married
life do some husbands begin to suspect that something
is missing from the marital relation.</p>

<p>If the male <em>subhuman</em> animal is excused from any
concern as to the proper reaction of the female,
that does not excuse any man and yet in so far as he
is animal he has no cause to act otherwise than
take his satisfaction without delay. The female animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
is accessible only in the rutting season. Human
woman is at all times accessible to the love expressed
in true mating. Human sexuality has not
only made a fundamental distinction between procreative
and erotic love episodes but also has almost
obliterated the periodicity in the sexual accessibility
of the woman. Therefore human love is <i lang="la">toto cælo</i>
different from animal copulation.</p>

<p>Considerations of the matter of control lead to
the conclusion that it is possible only by means of
the imagination, and because imagination is only the
reawakening with possible recombination of images
of past experiences, we are again confronted with
the problem of explaining how the experience to be
imaged in advance and looked for and waited for
may be presented both to the men who have and
to those who have not had sex experience.</p>

<p>As one cannot control anything except according
to a pattern, the pattern of controlled action must
be in the mind of any who intend to achieve control.</p>

<p>The method then, by which the husband is to
achieve control of his own, and thus over his wife’s
erotic reactions, is simply observation. He absolutely
requires fully to note the effect that what he
does has on his wife. If he succeeds in averting
his gaze, figuratively, from himself to his partner,
he will find that his own reactions take on a lessened
value in his eyes. His own reaction, one of ecstatic
pleasure is, in comparison with his wife’s, highly
concentrated on one detail of the love episode. This
is, of course, the most important one in animals
and would be in humans, if humans were animals,
but the fact that they are not and that erotic values
have developed in humans that do not exist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
animals, makes the man’s erotic acme take on a
much smaller significance and value.</p>

<p>Most husbands go through the love episode as
if they were animals, merely procreating progeny,
while yet starting from no such purpose. The purpose
is, of course, in so many men solely the purpose
to gratify themselves and not anyone else,
that, of course, any deliberate thought of ways and
means of gratifying any other, does not occur to
them.</p>

<p>Many men, indeed, are filled with embarrassment,
if not dismay, in perceiving a deeper and more extended
reaction in their women than they perceive
in themselves. With such a power which they observe
developing in their wives they do not know
how to compete. The situation of a husband who
finds himself developing in his wife a much richer
and fuller erotism than he thinks he has himself,
contains the unconscious factor of unflattering comparison.
Unconsciously he does not wish to find her
richer than himself because that gives him a sense
of unconscious inferiority and injures his feeling of
control. So the marital situation contains the unconscious
wish on the husband’s part not to find
in his wife an erotism greater than his own, entirely
apart from any conscious idea he may have that he
should not have an “oversexed” woman as a wife.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOLOGAMY VS. PROSTITUTION</span></h2>

<h3 id="section187">§ 187</h3>

<p>Marriage, in the sense of a legal bond between
two people who are bound together in no other
way than that affecting the interests of the egoistic-social
type, is not truly monogamous.</p>

<p>True monogamy between two people whose interests
are entirely implicated each with the other’s
on both the conscious and the unconscious level of
the erotic sphere needs a new name for which is
offered the term hologamy or whole marriage—complete
marriage.</p>

<p>The completeness implied here is that in which
both conscious and unconscious affection and passion
are involved. The hologamous union is the one in
which both partners have allowed instinctive impulses
from the unconscious to enter consciousness.
Their erotic insight consists in just this admission.</p>

<p>A hologamous erotic union is the assurance of
earthly felicity. It is utterly uncaused by egoistic-social
factors, though it may yet itself be the cause of
egoistic-social success. At any rate it is the most favourable
condition for the development of both members
of the union along egoistic-social lines. No man
now imperfectly married will fail to become more
successful in his life outside of the home by improving
the conditions of his life within it. The most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
condition has been clearly indicated. No
woman, now imperfectly married, but is waiting
(for that is all she can do) for the time when her
husband may chance to improve his erotic technique,
or learn from others how to do so.</p>

<p>It is tacitly assumed by both European and American
society that either the erotic or the egoistic-social
motives may independently and exclusively be
an adequate basis for a marriage. On the contrary
psychology shows that the erotic one is the only
one necessary, and that the egoistic-social is never
adequate, without the erotic, to constitute anything
but a mildly sentimental business relation between
man and woman.</p>

<h3 id="section188">§ 188</h3>

<p>The erotic motive is not represented or meant
by the ordinary expression used by married people
who say, of course, they love each other, or they
would not have married. Erotic means more than
“inspired by love” in the sense that the uninitiated
use the term love, which in common language is
of very wide application including even food and
clothing and all other egoistic-social expressions.
Erotic not only means inspired by love in the most
whole, passionate sense but implies also that the
persons activated by erotic motives have at least
some knowledge of the art of love, a knowledge
which includes something about the unconscious factor.
Otherwise love has not progressed to its higher
phase of erotism, and is mostly made up of affection
which is primarily egoistic-social. Love is a
word that has become too debased in the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
most people to serve as a term for what is here
outlined.</p>

<p>If on the other hand a marriage is a hologamous
one, in which the husband’s egoistic-social motives
are duly subordinated to his erotic motive, then
the erotic motive, freed from extraneous elements,
will cause both his conscious and his unconscious
passion to be centred on one woman. No other
marriage deserves the name. “Marriage” is derived
from the Latin word <i lang="la">mas</i>, male, and originally
referred only to the woman. She was “manned.”</p>

<p>If we should say today that a woman was thoroughly
manned we should be understood to mean
that she had sexual relations with one or more men.
To most we should not probably convey the meaning
that she had been completed, as an originally
defective demi-human being, by the necessary complement
to fill out her being to the totality of human
possibility, or that this completion involved the development
in her of an absolutely new attitude toward
the world which she could not attain without
physical and spiritual union with one man.</p>

<p>This implies also that the corresponding statement
should be made of the truly married man. As
an originally incomplete or defective demi-human
being lacking a complement, he needs to be completely
womaned, for which indeed there is no appropriate
word of Latin derivation. But if we
should say a man was comprehensively womaned
we should be understood to mean probably that he
had both a wife and concubines—that his affection
and egoistic-social impulses were gratified by the
former and his erotic needs by the latter. Yet it
is really not possible for a man to be perfectly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
completely womaned except by one woman. If his
counterpart is a mosaic of fifty different varicoloured
fragments he cannot be said to have done anything
but use a separate facet of each woman composing
the mosaic, and to have left unused all her other
facets. So he cannot be said to have seen any of
the other facets, a lack of vision constituting a kind
of anesthesia already mentioned in <a href="#section141">§ 141</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section189">§ 189</h3>

<p>Monogamy is not perfect if there is anesthesia
on either side. Anesthesia prevents complete union.
Only the mates who are completely directed each
to other are fully married, and marriage means not
partial but complete union. All degrees of fragmentary
attachment are defective monogamy and
so not monogamy at all, but unconscious polygamy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, that portion of the ego which is
not attached to one’s mate exhibits a tendency to
attach itself to some other one’s actual or potential
mate, simply because attachment is a case of tension
fixed to relax on a definite object, and if the legally
sanctioned object has been detached, if the tensions
natural to either sex are, by some complex, detached
from that object, they tend of themselves to seek
relaxation from some other person. If a man is
completely satisfied with his wife he will not only
seek no other woman, but will be dangerously attracted
by no other, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>So we can suppose a possible scale on which a
husband’s union with his wife, not hologamous, is
measured in units from 1 to 100 such that we might
say a man was sixty-five per cent married to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
wife, while yet she might be a hundred per cent
married to him. This gives 10,000 degrees of non-hologamous
marital union, M 1 — W 100 representing
a man with only slight interest in his wife
who is herself quite devoted to him. This man’s
other ninety-nine per cent of libido might be directed
to any number of other women. If it were directed
toward one other woman he would undoubtedly be
happier if he divorced and remarried. But it is the
thesis of this book that M 1 — W 100 is an impossibility.</p>

<p>A division of libido as disproportionate as this
would not imply much split in the man’s libido.
He would thus be ninety-nine per cent devoted to
his paramour and only one per cent to his wife.
His paramour would be his <i lang="la">de facto</i> wife. But if
his ninety-nine per cent of libido were directed toward
ninety-nine other women he would be called
a personality of maximum diffusion.</p>

<h3 id="section190">§ 190</h3>

<p>Now the personality in perfect health tends toward
the preservation of unity. The man whose
love life should include one hundred women would
be unable to devote more than one per cent of his
libido to one woman. He would be as far from
being a unit as, on the supposed scale, he could get.
He would be not one personality but a knocked-down
pile of parts waiting for a skilled mechanic
to assemble.</p>

<p>There are different types of men, those who tend
more, and those who tend less, to preserve their
own unity of personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>In general the progress from infancy to adulthood
is a progress from partial synthesis to complete
synthesis, so that the type of man whose
synthesis is incomplete is an infantile and dissociated
type of personality; or better than dissociated,
he might be called dissipated, disjointed, dismembered,
disassembled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the infantile condition can completely
satisfy, consciously, the infant of adult size.
This makes it difficult to approach him, makes him
difficult of access. If one present him with a fully
developed adult woman, he immediately recoils
much farther into his youth which he regards as a
fine quality. Because of the uncomfortable nature
of the comparison he unconsciously sees his inferiority
and unconsciously compensates for it, by
getting (in the only way he can) the feeling of
satisfaction that comes <i lang="la">via</i> mental autoerotism
whenever it fails to be obtained from the outside
world.</p>

<p>Adult society always produces this reaction somewhere
in the sub-adult psyche; so it becomes a great
problem, to devise some method for getting the
sub-adult to desire to react in adult modes.</p>

<h3 id="section191">§ 191</h3>

<p>Any plurality of women for a man implies reservation.
He cannot love all of a woman entirely
who thinks he loves in any degree any other woman.
If for example he “loved” one woman for her hair
and another for her eyes, another for her smile,
this could not be called love, but only physical sex
stimulation, or fetishism. Man’s supposed love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
more than one woman is where his reservation makes
him love one woman consciously and the others
unconsciously. But conscious love is not complete
love either, so that a man who consciously loves his
wife, but is not able to arouse in her the erotic acme
for any reason, cannot really be said to love her. He
may rationalize to himself that his wife is a good
mother to his children, a good housewife, patient,
painstaking, self-sacrificing; but that other women
whom he has seen interest him more in various intellectual
spheres.</p>

<p>His wife could not be a brilliant pianist, good
conversationalist, noted writer, artist, and singer,
all at the same time. It would be a physical impossibility.
He is interested in all those spheres in
other women; why should he not find pleasure in
their company? Why should he not call love that
interest which the thought-provoking, intellectually
stimulating woman arouses in him? Simply because
he would not and probably could not evoke in her
the fullest erotic reaction, and probably has not in
his own wife.</p>

<p>Plurality of women would compare with Guyot’s
violinist who should say he could play “Yankee
Doodle” only on one violin and only a concerto on
another, or could play only in E flat Major on
one, and A flat Minor on another, needing a different
instrument for each of the twenty-four keys.</p>

<p>That is not to say women are not different, but
only that man’s satisfaction in marrying one is dependent
largely on his own erotic technique which
is far more important and valuable than either
musical, artistic or any other technique; and that
if he does not play upon her emotional instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to his and her complete satisfaction, he has no
right to try to play on any other. Men go from
one musical erotic instrument to another, saying,
virtually: “I cannot play on this one. Of course,
I shall be able to play on the next. This is an inferior
one. Besides, the more practice I get the
better I shall be able to play. After I have had a
hundred or so I shall be a virtuoso.”</p>

<p>Women in general, however, are one as good as
another for the production of the erotic music which
can completely satisfy a man. He not only needs
no more than one but on <i lang="la">a priori</i> grounds it can
be safely said in almost every case that he can evoke
no more satisfactory erotic response from one than
from another, regarding this from the purely erotic
viewpoint and not confusing it with the egoistic-social
one.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it gratifies a man’s egoistic-social
impulse of self-magnification to have a woman flatter
him, to make him feel that his very presence
excites her, thrills her through and through. It is
almost automatic in some women thus to try to
play upon a man. But this too is never from purely
erotic motives, but largely from egoistic-social ones.</p>

<p>The man who prides himself on his success with
all women is constantly confusing the erotic with
the egoistic-social aim. And many a man considers
that he has fulfilled this erotic aim when, through
his personal magnetism or his susceptibility to flattery,
he has succeeded in getting a woman to consent
to try to surrender herself <i lang="la">in toto</i> to him.
But in using this pseudo-erotic situation as a factor
in the egoistic-social sequence, he is showing an
utter blindness to the essence of erotism, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
consists in the woman’s fully conscious placing of
the erotic motive ahead of the egoistic-social one
she has been following in her course of verbal or
other flattery and blandishment.</p>

<p>Can any satisfaction come to a woman except
the purely egoistic-social one of superseding another,
his wife, in the preference of a man whom she
endeavours to captivate? Can any satisfaction except
egoistic-social come to a man who prides himself
on his conquests, on how easily women fall
for him? Can he be said to be motivated more by
erotic or by egoistic-social impulses in his attempts
to add other women to his list, or to run risks and
arouse in his soul the excitements of danger?</p>

<h3 id="section192">§ 192</h3>

<p>If he need the excitements of a plurality of
women, it is proof that he cannot get a normal
amount of tension and relaxation from his own
wife. There are those, of course, who live their
married life on the theory that the physical tensions
and relaxations of sex are too gross for refined
marital relations, and that their wives would be
shocked if they experienced them. The boy brought
up with the <em>angel</em>-imago (or mother-imago, see
<a href="#section195">§ 195</a>) as his ideal of woman necessary to be
the mother of his children would inevitably identify
his wife with a prostitute if he succeeded in evoking
the highest psychical exaltation in her erotic sphere.
He has plurality ingrained in his nature from the
cradle; the feminine sex is not one but at least two:
angel and prostitute. Unable to conceive the two
existing in one woman, in fact unwilling to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
this, he perforce puts the mother of his own children
in the angel class and would be shocked if she
evinced any of the characteristics of the other class.</p>

<p>The irony of which is that whatever reactions
the prostitute shows are her attempt to imitate
what she conceives as the highest type of erotism,
what her patron’s highest erotic development would
call for. Whatever impulses of erotic nature she
has, which are few enough in the class that practise
promiscuity for pay, are so overweighted by the
egoistic-social impulses of material self-advancement,
that they lose whatever value they might
otherwise have.</p>

<p>A so-called prostitute, like Victor Hugo’s Mlle.
Drouet, who after promiscuity devotes herself with
absolute fidelity to one man is no longer a prostitute.
She has, in thus placing the erotic above the
egoistic-social motive, fulfilled the highest human
function except that of parenthood.</p>

<p>It is possible that a man of many women may
think he is seeking for his final mate. Such men
have been heard to express somewhat similar sentiments.
“If I could,” said one roué, “effect a grand
passion with some woman, she would be the only
one for me.” He thought he could not gain this
result from his wife, but if he were a whole man
with erotic unity instead of a roué with the disassembled
psyche, he could effect the grand passion
quite as easily with his wife as with another woman.</p>

<h3 id="section193">§ 193</h3>

<p>Some considerations on the status of prostitution
are necessary in every book that attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
discuss marital relations. Far as the poles asunder
though they may be in externals, they are yet the
common activity of the same man in many instances.
Figures show that the married man is the main
support of the prostitute. What he does to his
psyche in the direction of actually splitting it by
this double life has been described more or less in
the following manner. It is not merely that he
either lies to one woman and consorts with another
and is under the psychical strain of remembering
never to confuse the parts of this double drama he
is enacting. It is worse than that.</p>

<p>It has been shown through studies of the unconscious
in men that show a strong leaning toward
fallen women, that they are unwittingly reënacting
a jealousy drama of their own infancy in which
they try to rescue from the father their own object
of earliest love, their mother (cf. <a href="#section179">§ 179</a>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the average man’s bringing up leads
him unconsciously to separate all the women in the
world into two classes. This simple division is
characteristic of childhood, which sees everything
either black or white and does not conceive fine
gradations. The two classes of women are the angel-mother
type and the devil-prostitute type, and this
distinction with hardly any other he maintains sometimes
till the end of his life.</p>

<h3 id="section194">§ 194</h3>

<p>Strangely enough this division of women into
two classes, while it is made by most men in their unconscious,
evokes opposite reactions in two types of
men, some of whom are found by the psychoanalysts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
as “more potent” with the prostitute type, while
others are more potent with their wives. Yet these
men are not wholly potent to the extent of carrying
out the love episode to a conclusion perfectly satisfactory
to their wives, and in the illicit relation they
are still more precipitant.</p>

<p>It seems, however, most probable that the illicit
woman has the effect on them of producing an
overvaluation of some particular factor in the nature
of a fetish which has lost its overplus of emotional
value in the case of the wife. As has been
already pointed out, this overvaluation of one or
another factor in the total situation of the episode
has an accelerating effect in the episode with the
less familiar woman, an effect which, because of
habit, has become less in the episode with the wife.</p>

<p>Another element in the situation is that with the
woman of the prostitute type the man is concerned
in no degree with any reaction on her part, whereas
with his wife he may, in some cases, feel a certain
dim sense of responsibility. Added to which the
professional prostitute frequently pretends to be
controlled, while the average wife does not.</p>

<p>It happens that this unimaginative paucity of
merely twofold division of women unfortunately
involves almost without exception the unconscious
assumption that his sexual gratification is the function
of the prostitute and is both absent from and
not supplied by the woman of the angel type, from
which stratum of society he naturally selects his
wife. No wonder then that many men consider their
wives “oversexed” if they show any great passion.
“Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.”
This type of man who rigidly demands that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
wife shall be an angel (as, when an infant, he
thought that his mother was) makes, or tries to
make out of her a sexless worker or butterfly while
he goes to the prostitute weed for the satisfaction
of his imperative sexual needs. He is unable to
act as if his wife had exactly the same human body
as himself, the same or homologous glands and
identical sexual needs with himself, the denial of
which is the cause of much if not most of the nervousness
of women and accountable for a good part
of their ill health and weakness.</p>

<h3 id="section195">§ 195</h3>

<p>The boy of five or less has no means of knowing
that his mother has any sexual needs, jealous though
he may be of his father. The same boy when a
man of thirty, if he keep the same childish viewpoint
that women of the angel type are as angelically
sexless as his mother was to him, will, unless
he picks out a woman of the other type for a wife,
which is, of course, exceedingly rare, never be wholly
free from inhibitions against the full development of
the true love episode with his wife. Regarding the
prostitute as of another caste, he thus avoids with her
alone the inhibitions caused by his childish separation
of all women into two diametrically opposed castes.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this early-formed association
of mother (and of course, later, wife) with absence
of sexual interests or even instincts may in some men
be a large factor in causing the repression of the
majority of the components of the love episode.
One component, however, alone, is impossible for
the man to repress, though he may later find to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
supreme satisfaction that he can control it and
retard it; namely, the final relaxation of all his erotic
tension.</p>

<p>If he continues love episodes with his wife and
has a fixed but unconscious idea that with a wife all
varieties of preliminary love actions, in brief, every
component but the one to him absolutely essential
component of dropping his burden of erotic tension,—which
by the way he might just as well drop elsewhere—are
actions more appropriate in a brothel
than in a home, he will tend more and more to
avoid with his wife all but the essential, as he
virtually conceives it.</p>

<h3 id="section196">§ 196</h3>

<p>It is admitted by all students of married life
that not less passion but more is needed, and the
precipitant husband undoubtedly needs more. For
him the love episode’s passion is concentrated into
the climax of it. It has no beginning, no middle,
and no end, for it rarely if ever gives the full satisfaction
that is gained by the husband who really
takes care of his wife’s erotic responses. For the
ignorant husband, who is emotionally about five years
old, the love episode is featureless and crude like
a five-year-old child’s drawing of a man on a slate.
It has no proportions, a head, rectangular body and
two straight lines for legs and quadrangular sinkers
for feet and asterisk hands.</p>

<p>The passionless love episode is no love episode at
all as it lacks the essential of deep love. Putting
more passion into his love for his wife is of course
exactly what the man, whose woman’s world consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of only two widely sundered castes, is unable
to do unless he succeeds in overcoming the early-fixed
habit of his thought about what he knows as
love. But putting more passion into his love for
his wife is exactly what he must do to be fully a
man and to control her erotic emotions.</p>

<p>One who is fully a woman latently, as are all
with negligible exceptions, is never fully developed
into a woman, actually, except by the man who can
play on her, as on a violin, all the melodies of which
she is capable. She will never know herself unless
she is thus developed by man. She will be like an
undeveloped photographic plate.</p>

<h3 id="section197">§ 197</h3>

<p>The attitude of society toward prostitution is,
as a whole, as unorganized and haphazard as could
be, in all civilized countries. Both kinds of laws are
made, prohibitive and regulative, neither of which
has any more effect on men’s actions than would a
law have which attempted to prohibit drawing
breath or to regulate the number of inhalations per
hour. In general the laws have been prohibitive
and have met the same fate as any prohibitive legislation.
It has been realized by a few deep thinkers
that no prohibitions have to be made against what
nobody ever thinks of doing, and that the existence
of a prohibitive law is proof of a widespread tendency
to do the thing prohibited. All prohibition is,
from the point of view of both conscious and unconscious
psychology, unscientific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section198">§ 198</h3>

<p>A part of the motive that leads the husband to
resort to the prostitute is the widespread notion
mentioned by Ellis (op. cit., VI) that prostitution
has a civilization value in adding “an element of
gaiety and variety to the ordered complexity of
modern life, a relief from the monotony of its
mechanical routine, a distraction from its dull and
respectable monotony.”</p>

<p>These are the arguments advanced for the use
of alcohol also. While admitting, however, the desirability,
indeed even the necessity, of variety in
life which means the family life as well, we should
not forget that the lack of variety in marital existence
is mostly if not exclusively due to the infantility
of the husband. Marriage is the most vital institution
of society, but the one that has been most
carelessly left to its own haphazard development.</p>

<p>For this abandonment of marriage to its own
fate amidst the most hostile possible environment
of rapidly developing egoistic-social impulses, the
husband is solely to blame. His fault, however, is
primarily due to his bringing up and chiefly to that
feature of the mother-imago which leads him invariably
to look for interest, variety and all good
things from the mother.</p>

<p>The child’s frequent whine, “Mother, what can I
<em>do</em>?” is here virtually repeated by the unimaginative
husband, defended by the sexologist and answered
by the prostitute. If, as has been intimated before
in this book, age cannot wither woman nor custom
stale her infinite variety, then the infinite variety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
or enough of it, at any rate, to satisfy any husband,
should be evoked from his wife.</p>

<p>In the fragmentary love of the average married
man it is not to be expected, of course, that he will
find much variety. For fragments do not, or at
any rate, a single fragment does not, provide much.</p>

<p>The relief from the monotony of the average
married life is most desirable in every way, but the
relief can come in the best way only from the variegation
of the marital pattern, a change that is fully
within the power of any husband who will acquaint
himself with the findings of the modern psychology
of love.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NEW MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Certain it is that the chrysalis, man, is emerging
from the cocoon of tradition.—<span class="smcap">Dr. Robie.</span></p>

</div>

<h3 id="section199">§ 199</h3>

<p>The new husband is the man who realizes that
the type of passion which he has idealized to himself
as appropriate for himself is logically quite as appropriate
for his wife. Quite as logically he may
deduce that if there is, therefore, to be not only
no double standard with regard to promiscuity, but
also no double standard with regard to the rights
to erotic exaltation, he may create a single standard
by means of reducing the number of his love episodes
to a minimum of intercourse for procreation
only. Many men have done this or nearly this.
But all who try it find that there are two sets of
difficulties in the way, the difficulty of attaining this
semi-ascetic end from the purely volitional point of
view, and the difficulty, or more exactly the detriment,
which modern science is beginning to demonstrate
as inevitably coming to the psychic as well
as the physical powers of the ascetic individual.</p>

<p>Also the single standard idea is to be transferred
to the degree to which each partner carries, and is
carried, in the love episode. Truly a double standard
in this respect is little better than a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
standard in promiscuity. There is no good reason
why it should be right for a husband to reach his
erotic acme at each love episode and wrong, or even
indifferent, for the wife. The true single standard
of married life implies, therefore, that the same
standard of erotic gratification should be for both
husband and wife. Man has no biological privilege
here over woman. What is right for man must
also be right for woman. So we see that the new
husband is the one who recognizes the single standard
of monogamy and also that of hologamy which
provides for the wife’s erotic acme as well as for
the husband’s.</p>

<h3 id="section200">§ 200</h3>

<p>Woman fundamentally and biologically calls for
man to be the stronger to impregnate by force the
impregnable fortress of her femininity, and he who
fails to do this fails to make a good husband. The
training for husbandship, irrespective of wealth or
social position, should start from this fundamental
principle of masculine control of the marital situation.
This control should begin at the altar, and
never weaken, never relax for a moment, except
at the times when the wife is by her erotic emotions
at the climax of the love episode incapable of witnessing
its relaxation, at least of envying her husband.</p>

<p>After a long courtship in which there has been
much worship of the woman by the man, there may
tend to be preserved, to hang over, a sort of worship
habit in the husband; but this should give place
to an inflexible attitude and a positive aggressive
treatment, Petruchio-like, yet only in the erotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
sphere, increasing in power as the years go by.
Woman will test it hourly to detect any weakening,
jealous of the strength to be handed down to her
offspring. It is unconscious in her. She cannot help
it.</p>

<p>In the modern woman with a vocation, to which
there cannot be a possible objection if it does not
exclude her proper maternity, the relation to her
husband must still be one of emotional subservience.
She cannot control him emotionally without making
herself a mother-imago to him. He cannot, even
unconsciously, accept this control of himself by her,
without regressing to the condition of being dominated
by the mother-imago, without being to her
as her child and not her man.</p>

<p>Modern marriage must be an entirely new and
different thing from most previous marital relations.
Mastery over the woman must remain, if
marriage is to continue; but it must be a spiritual
mastery, a love mastery in place of the old Rome-inherited
legal, economic and physical mastery.
Thus the poor husband of a rich wife need lose no
mastery, nor need the non-professional husband of
a professional wife, nor the unintellectual husband
of an intellectual wife, the uneducated husband of
an educated wife.</p>

<p>Mastery or control does not consist any more in
the regulation by the man of any egoistic-social activities
of the woman, the dictating of what she
shall do or wear or think, nor in the acts of the man
himself consciously designed to steer her this way
or that. Mastery does consist in what the husband,
and the husband alone, can make the wife feel. It
does consist in the establishment and maintenance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a sense on her part of belonging to him, which he can
develop even though granting her in the egoistic-social
sphere, the most absurd license—the <i lang="de">Hörigkeit</i>
(mentioned by Freud) based on the peculiar
intensity with which he gratified after awakening
it in early married life, her erotic need.</p>

<h3 id="section201">§ 201</h3>

<p>Possibly the great increase in the number of
divorces is due to the increasing expectation of
something unutterably fine in marriage and an
inevitable disillusionment resulting from concrete
experience. There would be no divorce on the
grounds of adultery if the married woman felt that
her paramour could give her no joy remotely resembling
what her husband could. The adultery
of the man, too, comes from disappointment. Where
there is absolutely complete satisfaction the motive
for adultery cannot exist.</p>

<p>The man or woman with conscious and unconscious
passion of the one developed into a habit
may be attracted by other women but the other
woman’s attractiveness will not be as great as his
wife’s. And deflection in either husband or wife, if
they think at all precisely on their action, must be
quite repugnant to them in every way. The uncontrolled
man who does not master his wife’s erotic
emotions is disappointed in her and seeks his supreme
gratification with another woman who appears
to be able to give him what he thinks he
cannot get from his wife in the way of appreciation,
sympathy or understanding.</p>

<p>If this is the man’s attitude then, of course, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cannot have grasped the idea of the higher monogamy,
which is not that of getting but of giving. No
man in any degree cognizant of the concept of true
mating can fail to find even the woman to whom
he happens to be married, able to receive if he
practises properly the technique of presentation.
He must have found certain qualities in her before
he married her, which his awkwardness in presenting
himself have perturbed, and he can now review
these and work upon them until he is utterly accepted.
For his presentation of himself and his
service to her in the worship of Eros are the only
means toward his adequately virile satisfaction.
<i lang="la">Credite expertis.</i></p>

<p>No one who has had prosperity in the egoistic-social
sphere, who has had a comfortable home, for
example, will choose adversity, will thereafter
prefer to live in a tenement, noisy, squalid. No
man who has experienced the greater profundities
of virile control of the total erotic situation will
choose to give any less of himself to his wife. No
wife who has received from her husband the maximum
that a man can give, which is himself—that is,
his supreme control of himself and of her—will
choose to look for anything greater or higher, for
it does not exist even in the most extravagant
imagination.</p>

<h3 id="section202">§ 202</h3>

<p>In the marriage of the future we must make sure
that the art of love is thoroughly learned by the
husband. Without it, he has only a small chance
of making a successful marriage. And we must
see to it that this new art of love be not like Ovid’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the adulterer’s art of winning a woman away from
her home, but the husband’s art of retaining her
in it.</p>

<p>This will require a readjustment, possibly of the
concept of “home.” The home meant here is not
in any sense the material house and furniture and
embellishments. The home is the family, to which
all the members should belong in a sense far more
spiritual than the average. The truly mated couple
belong to the family forever and to the children,
until the latter marry and make families of their
own. Any deflection from the purely hologamous
ideal on the part of either the husband-father or
wife-mother is a misfortune to the latter, but
unequivocally the fault of the former.</p>

<p>The marriage of the future, if it is to follow the
single-standard pattern of equal joy for equal mutuality,
will be in no way inferior to any type of
so-called romantic marriage of today. It will have
all the totality of fusion of the individual’s body
and soul, all the fusion of the personalities of the
two mates. It will have all the finality and indissolubility
now wished for it by the present generation
whose marital relations begin to crumble in
a year or less. It will never degenerate into a
situation where life seems not worth living, but
will be the only circumstance in which life is consciously
and perennially known, as well as believed
and felt, to be thoroughly worth while.</p>

<p>By their confusion of the two levels of control
women lose much of the happiness that would come
to them from the direct control exercised over them
by men, on the erotic level. Into the love episode
egoistic-social impulses, being the uninvited guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
at a feast, only intrude. Women’s sphere of active
control is limited, on all rational grounds, to the
work in the world which they choose for themselves
apart from being wives.</p>

<p>It is equally true, too, that if the erotic life is
to be rationally developed in both partners the husband
will have to keep carefully separated the egoistic-social
in his life from the erotic. There is
much talk about the ability of a woman to be a
mother, which tacitly implies being a housewife,
and at the same time to be a professional woman
or to do anything whatever of an egoistic-social
nature outside of her home.</p>

<p>The idea never seems to have occurred to anybody
that in an equitable marriage at least, not to
mention an ideal one, the husband has any part to
play in the construction of that spiritual situation
which should constitute the home. The father
really has as vital a part to play in the home as
the mother. There is no perfect home that does
not contain these two absolutely equally unifying
factors. “What is home without a father?” is
quite as pertinent a question as the other trite one.</p>

<p>This does not for a moment imply that the duties
of the father and the mother in the material home
should be the same. This would give only a literal
verbal significance to the statement that a man’s
duty is quite as much toward his home as is a
woman’s. If we were simply using words that
sounded reasonable we might as well repeat the oft
expressed and seemingly perfectly balanced retort of
woman to her husband: “If I have to <em>bear</em> the
child, why on earth shouldn’t <em>you</em> care for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section203">§ 203</h3>

<p>To illustrate with a concrete example the utter
helplessness of some of the finest women, the following
excerpt is made, with his permission, from a
letter received by Dr. Robie:</p>

<p>“The man whom I finally married came into my
life as an intellectual wonder. I marvelled at his
knowledge and his worldly poise.... Whenever
I pleaded for consideration, kindness, he would say:
‘Haven’t you a home, clothes, money, a baby? What
more do you want?’ or ‘Haven’t I told you once
that I love you? Can’t you take that for granted?’</p>

<p>“No gentleness, no petting, just hardness and
the greatest conceit over his own personality and
ability.</p>

<p>“I found at dances that other men could thrill
me, and one man in particular.... He never
knew it.</p>

<p>“I got the reputation of being a perfect mother,
and a beauty, and my spirit never has been broken;
but my faith is broken. My love is as dead as last
year’s leaves; and I scorn men who stop being lovers
on their wedding night.</p>

<p>“Health, enthusiasm, good nature, big sense of
humour, beauty, ideal birth inheritance, magnetism,
yes, and passion—for I am not cold, but <em>very</em> impulsive
and affectionate—all this lost to the right
man, and the wrong one quite content, apparently,
in his worldly successes, and with a cultured wife
who does not bother him, and keeps his noisy brood
of children at a distance.</p>

<p>“This comes from a bursting heart. It is true I
am a success as a mother; and the world thinks I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
am in all ways. Yet that greatest of all things,
LOVE, is denied me.”</p>

<h3 id="section204">§ 204</h3>

<p>The father’s part in the home is something, however,
far more hypersomatic than that, more spiritual.
The truly husbanded wife will make the egoistic-social
aspects of home-keeping so much her own
business that she will tend to appropriate more
than she should really have. And the thoughtless
man will let her and wonder why she is tired and
cross.</p>

<p>If rugs have to be beaten and windows washed,
and there is no money to hire a man to do it, the
wife will do it, frequently, and the husband, who
does not husband his wife’s health and beauty will
let her. And so on up the egoistic-social scale till we
reach the millionaire who might do certain things
for his wife much more acceptably than hirelings,
but dissociates himself more and more from her.</p>

<p>The management of the children is really an
egoistic-social affair, in which some men are much
better able to plan, and execute plans than are most
women. The management of very young children
in the home is something that no <i lang="la">paterfamilias</i> can
afford to leave entirely to women. This is by all
odds the most important part of the child’s life.</p>

<p>It does not mean that the banker or politician
should spend hour after hour in the nursery, though,
indeed, he should know pretty well what goes on
there. The nature of the personal contacts the
child gets in the nursery is a determining factor in
many cases, in the way in which he will later behave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in his marital existence. In the nursery, meaning
by that any locality where the child spends most of
his playtime and sleeping time, he gets the experiences
from which later he may develop neuroses,
phobias, and other emotional disorders. He forms
there usually his mother-imago, for even if he
belongs to the class of children who never see their
own mothers except on the rarest occasions, he will
form his mother ideal from his hired nurse, or from
any other woman with whom he comes into close
contact.</p>

<p>Here then, the egoistic-social trends of the parents
play an important rôle in determining the
erotic life of the child. The egoistic-social pressure
exerted on one or both parents withdraws them
from their children, and partly or wholly orphans
them. Many a child’s father is no more personal
than a checking bank.</p>

<p>Not only, therefore, does the absorption of the
parents by egoistic-social trends diminish the chances
of their own erotic development as husband and
wife, a development that takes time, energy and
imagination, but it deprives their children of the
proper environment in which to develop the germs
of future wholesome erotism.</p>

<p>Parents and children should spend a certain
amount of time in each other’s company during
which they do nothing but love each other all around
and have a jolly good time together. It is just as
important for the parents to banish egoistic-social
claims for short periods and actually loaf and fool
around with the children as it is for the children
to have a taste of adult idling company. Such, for
example, is a real picnic or camping trip or ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
voyage, or any situation that brings parents and
children together.</p>

<h3 id="section205">§ 205</h3>

<p>It is important, too, for every woman to keep
clearly separated in her mind and in her action the
two levels, egoistic-social and erotic. Only then is
she in a satisfactory position to become a wife in
a higher sense than that in which most women are
wives, and her becoming a mother need interfere
in no way with her remaining a wife to her husband.</p>

<p>It is therefore to the advantage of man to
realize that, however much he may value his wife’s
clear intuition in egoistic-social matters, he is to be
sure about their utter exclusion from matters purely
erotic. A man can never fall in love with a conventionally
so-called unattractive woman solely because
she has a good business head. If any man
should think so, he would find, on closer analysis,
that, if he was really in love, his motive was truly
erotic. If he cannot find any really erotic factor in
his attitude toward her, his union with her can
never be a complete marriage.</p>

<p>He has confused the two levels. He cannot love
her <em>because</em> she can manage a library or a bond
broker’s office or an insurance agency, any more
than he can love her really because she knows how
to make fudge. He may be attracted by the
fudge. He is undoubtedly attracted unconsciously
by other factors truly erotic in her character. Otherwise
he would be more prudent to marry the fudge
rather than the girl.</p>

<p>Similarly if the woman thinks she attracts by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
her business or culinary ability she is confusing
levels. There are some women who unfortunately,
because erroneously, believe they have little or no
erotic attraction. Plain in face, not well formed,
possibly under-weight, complexions not clear, they
think that by sedulously following egoistic-social
trends they can make an appeal to other people and
particularly to men. They fail to see that these
trends have hardly anything to do with love, that,
once they love, their form improves, that the homeliest
face, once lighted by the fire of love, has a beauty
all its own, pure and irresistible.</p>

<p>The same is true of unloving, unillumined, unfired
men. Judging erroneously from a confusion of the
two levels, they fail to see not only that erotic trends
are the strongest and most universal in the world,
but that being the fundamentally vital trends they
are almost inexhaustible and provide the untapped
energy which the egoistic-social thinking of these
diffident men makes them fear to draw upon.</p>

<p>The mathematical exactness of the comparison
of men on the egoistic-social level makes many a
man think his erotic impulses are similarly inferior.
He should ponder well upon the prodigality of
nature, remembering that he, too, is part of nature.</p>

<h3 id="section206">§ 206</h3>

<p>Unrestrained nature is most prodigal. The
thousands of ova and millions of spermatozoa produced
in every woman and man show that the analogy
is false that is drawn between the human body
and a mere container like a basket. Anything with
life cannot be exhausted until life has gone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
yet through asceticism the secretions can be rendered
great or small or almost non-existent. Men
can make eunuchs of themselves by force of will,
yet their egoistic-social performances are not improved
but rather impoverished by the process.</p>

<p>Men should train themselves to produce, which
consists in being lavish of self in every manner.
The richest are those who give most. The miser
is the poorest man in the world and the most
miserable.</p>

<p>Fear of giving self is the fear of losing self.
What most men fear if they love their wives too
much is that they will impoverish themselves and
enrich their wives, thus making their wives contemptuous
of their resultant poverty. But the
poorest man or woman is the one who has not begun
to love, and many are such even in the married
state.</p>

<p>And they begin to enrich themselves even more
than each other, when they give each to other the
uttermost that is in them.</p>

<p>Giving is the only thing that produces fertility
of giving. It is tapping the inexhaustible, the only
way in which to unite oneself to the infinite. Withholding
is closing up the gate to universal strength
and power.</p>

<p>Control is not annihilation or denial. It is direction
of an endless stream of energy. If the energy
is not delivered it cannot be directed and therefore
cannot be controlled.</p>

<p>The tragedy of present-day marital life lies in
the deception men practise on themselves by believing
that annihilation is a kind of control.</p>

<p>The facts of the intimate marital relations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
most couples are too unlovely to be welcomed by
most people, but in order to progress it is necessary
to face them.</p>

<p>In the new marriage the husband, therefore, will
relinquish certain of the egoistic-social spheres of
action and will confine his attention solely to those
most closely associated with the erotic. He will
assume the responsibility for these.</p>

<h3 id="section207">§ 207</h3>

<p>Trial marriage is little more than a method of
testing man’s control in the erotic sphere. It implies
that if a man is found lacking in control over one
woman, he may be tried with another, in the hope
that with the second up to the <em>n</em>th he may find a
woman whom he can control. But as stated elsewhere
in this book the probability of an uncontrolled
man’s acquiring control by a superficial trial
and error method is almost nil.</p>

<p>Science has not a word to say against permanent
marriage if the pair are really compatible. What
constitutes compatibility, however, is much more
a mental attitude on the part of the husband. A
man that thinks he has to have a special, peculiar
type of woman for a wife, or because of a bringing
up in an excessively romantic family thinks there
is only one woman in the world, specially born for
him, who alone can make him happy in marriage,
or who thinks he has found her when he has fallen
in love at first sight, assumes no responsibility for
his own happiness, but fatalistically waits for destiny
to provide him with a suitable spouse.</p>

<p>“Spouse” is derived from Latin <i lang="la">spondeo</i> which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
at the root of the word <em>response</em>, and means “to
promise solemnly.” This refers to what the person
confidently expects to <em>get</em>, not himself contribute
to the union. But it has been clear to the seers of
all ages that giving is the only true getting.</p>

<p>On the basis of giving, almost any woman can
be made a wife, but never in the sense of spouse if
it has its ancient meaning of a person bound to
give something.</p>

<p>If a young man is given the proper training in
the right way, which shows him that the most intensely
physical contacts are emotionally worthless
without the spiritual factor in the truly erotic, and
that the intimacies of marital life are far more
determined by hypersomatic (spiritual) facts than
by physical ones, that he has the privilege of making
his married life as romantic as he wishes or can
leave it quite prosaic and dull; if he knows this,
even a provisional marriage entered into with a
woman not positively distasteful to him can be
made a triumphant success.</p>

<p>The proviso, however, will be made by most
people that there must be an original rapport between
the two. It is the unequivocal position of
this book, on the contrary, that the rapport, even if
it never existed, can be created by the husband, by
means of his own conscious creative power.</p>

<h3 id="section208">§ 208</h3>

<p>This implies neither that the rapport is solely a
physical one nor that it is based on solely physical
factors. Nor does it imply that a perfect marital
love that has all the qualities of the romantic may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
not, by the proper behaviour on the husband’s part,
be progressively developed as the years pass.
Indeed, the fully matured love of at least a quarter
of a century’s duration is the only marital love that
has any claim to be called romantic. In the young,
love is not romantic but may be spectacular, in its
expression, or in the egoistic-social circumstances
which surround it, but the only perfect love of a
man and a woman is the one that has the growth
of years.</p>

<p>If a man knowing the true technique which is
more spiritual (more hypersomatic) than physical
in every instance, though impossible without the
complete combination of physical and spiritual,
chooses any woman whatever of his own free will,
and uses with her the real love technique of word
and deed, he cannot fail to find in her his erotic
complement, if she be really a woman.</p>

<p>The choice, it is admitted, is the work largely of
his unconscious. The unconscious is an absolutely
accurate registering apparatus; and as such is the
real foundation of the choice of a mate.</p>

<p>But it should not for a moment be forgotten that
the unconscious mechanisms that present this woman
as more attractive than that to a man are only the
foundation of the edifice of his marital love which it
is his triumph to build with his own hands.</p>

<p>And it should equally well be remembered that
the erotic control is his, and will remain his, if the
marriage is to prove happy; also that the erotic
control is more spiritual than physical, though it
can never endure without the physical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="section209">§ 209</h3>

<p>The duty of marriage is the procreation of
healthy children. The privilege and pleasure of
marriage is what Havelock Ellis has called the play
side of love.</p>

<p>If the husband does not secure and by a superior
knowledge of love insist on securing in his wife this
essential of human marriage, his marriage is only
legal, only social, and has no love instinct back of
it. It is not an erotic union. Erotic unions are the
only healthy ones.</p>

<p>Erotic unions are the only healthy ones not merely
in the sense of health-giving to the partners, but
also in the sense of having themselves a healthy
growth in progressively embracing all human activities,
in which the partners are concerned in egoistic
and social lines, embracing them in such a way that
the love instinct increases its control over the ego
instinct. This increase is the real object of a love
marriage, not increase of wealth, honour, distinction,
and experience of the world but increase of the
dominance of love over self.</p>

<h3 id="section210">§ 210</h3>

<p>Possibly this dependence of the woman on the
man to unfold her accounts for man’s instinctive
desire to marry a virgin. Unconsciously he may
imagine that to make her most his own, she should
have been influenced erotically by no other man.</p>

<p>Whether or not the future development of the
general attitude toward marriage will include an
insistence on the woman’s being a virgin when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
enters the marital state, there are still some considerations
concerning both the physical and the
psychical condition of virginity, both of men and
of women, that are pertinent today, and that seem
advisable to take up at this point.</p>

<h3 id="section211">§ 211</h3>

<p>The study of the unconscious throws an important
sidelight upon the matter of the termination of physical
virginity of women.</p>

<p>It has been clearly shown that this termination
when, as is frequently the case, it is accompanied by
sudden and severe pain on the rupture of the hymen,
is the cause of a revulsion of feeling on the woman’s
part, utterly incommensurate with the actual intensity
and duration of the pain, a feeling also of
which she never is, and possibly never becomes,
directly conscious; but, if the pain is caused by the
action of the husband, it is the cause of a resentment
which, in the wife’s unconscious, is ever after
associated with her husband.</p>

<p>From this point of view it would seem more
felicitous if that unconscious association of ideas
could be made in her mind with some other man,
e.g., the family doctor, if it is an inevitable association
and absolutely uncontrollable by the wife, as
all deeply unconscious mental processes are. It
would seem that a man would profit by not being
the particular man associated in his wife’s unconscious
with a painful incident that cuts so deep.
This applies to the average uninstructed man but
not to the adept or even inexperienced man who is
willing and able to act intelligently and profit by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
knowledge now available about how to avoid this
one of the many mischances that may occur in the
case of the virgin episode.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of the unconscious resentment
due to the forcible and painful termination of
merely physical virginity is recognized in the frequently
happy second married life of women who
have lost their first husbands, and in the customs
of some savage tribes in which no woman becomes
a wife until she has been deflowered by the official
appointed by the tribe for that special purpose.</p>

<p>The inference from these facts is not necessarily
that a man will be more happy with a wife who
comes to him “impure” or widowed; though this
may be the case. The inference is on the other
hand that the man, if he knows enough, will be able
in the very first love episode so to act that the bride
inflicts any necessary pain on herself, and not he
on her; making all the difference in the world to
her, because in this case, never, even in her own
unconscious, can she lay up against her husband
this cause of resentment. The technically instructed
husband thus gains an initial prestige with his wife
and with her unconscious, which enormously increases
his erotic control of her emotions—the <i lang="la">sine
qua non</i> of a felicitous marriage, that essential condition
for fully functioning adult human life.</p>

<h3 id="section212">§ 212</h3>

<p>Women are unable to control or direct their own
development in the erotic sphere up to the point
of greatest exaltation. They are perforce required
to be developed by men. But, in from fifty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
seventy per cent of marriages, men are too uninterested
or too ignorant to develop their wives’ erotism
to this point, and, of course, to develop their
own erotism to the necessary degree of self-control
whereby they can secure the total erotic relaxation
of their wives.</p>

<p>So that when we say that men are more virginal
than women we imply a responsibility on the husband’s
part, and none whatever on the wife’s part,
for the proper erotic development which alone constitutes
the basis of a permanent monogamy.</p>

<p>That is the reason for saying that in the love
episode control is the husband’s organically, fundamentally,
biologically. The husband reader of this
book should ask himself whether he has exercised
the adequate amount of control in the erotic sphere.
Has he left his wife, the mother of his children, in
the condition of being psychically a virgin? If he
has, he must realize that he, too, is in a sense, himself
a virgin. This signifies primarily that because
his wife’s erotism is left undeveloped, his own is
too. Undeveloped erotism is no secure bond, no
perfect assurance, of a true monogamy.</p>

<p>He will need to take the matter into his own
hands and truly marry his wife by means of fully
developing his own and her erotism. This need of
marrying one’s own wife is the greatest need of the
present day. It can be fulfilled only by more knowledge
and more (truly erotic) passion on the part
of the husband.</p>

<p>The husband, therefore, who has not in this sense
married his own wife, is illogical in thinking that
there is any justice or beauty or poetry or romance
in any attempted affiliation, liaison or other intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
relation with any other woman. On the other hand,
the husband who has married his wife in this sense,
will neither seek nor need the intimacy of any other
woman than his wife.</p>

<p>The phantasied happiness with any other woman
rests solely on the thought that the erotic development
of the other would be easier for him, or that
it would be unnecessary. If it is unnecessary, it has
been accomplished by some other man; for true
mutual erotic relations are not attained by a woman
alone or by two women, man being the only developer
of woman’s erotism.</p>

<p>He may think indeed that some extra-marital
woman actually loves him, and that his wife does
not. This may be true, if he is fully developed
himself, has made sincere attempts for years to
develop his wife and, in spite of his own best
thought and advice of erotologists, has found that
she is definitely ineducable. This is an exceedingly
rare case.</p>

<p>It may <em>appear</em> that the extra-marital woman loves
him, and that he loves her; but the experience of
many centuries has shown that, except in the rarest
of instances, the woman is ignorant of her own true
feelings and that the attempt on the man’s part to
develop her erotically would be a failure.</p>

<p>If his own desire for the extra-marital woman
is conditioned, as it so often is, on the mentally
autoerotic nature of his own satisfactions, which
his lack of success with his wife has, in most cases,
amply proved, his success in the adulterous union
is not likely to be any greater. He will be most
likely to expect an easier conquest in the extra-marital
liaison than in the marital relation. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
going from the marital one to one fancied easier is
an evidence of his mental autoerotism.</p>

<h3 id="section213">§ 213</h3>

<p>In conclusion it may be said that the feeling on
the part of any critic of modern civilization that
marriage has been a failure applies only to the
facts of the imperfect carrying out of the ideal of
monogamy. We may remind such critics that, like
Christianity, monogamy (in the sense of hologamy
or the total physical and psychical fusion of man
and wife) cannot be called a failure, because in
the vast majority of persons, it simply <em>has not been
given a fair trial</em>. External, conscious, superficial
fidelity is not true hologamy any more than lip
service is Christianity; and, as a whole, civilized
peoples have not yet succeeded in attaining faith
either in the one or in the other.</p>

<p>This chapter is written; but, because of the egoistic-social
legislation of fifty years ago, cannot be
printed.</p>

<p>While it is lawful to inform readers that abortion
is a crime and in every way unnatural, the
practice of —— and ——, and the use of ——,
——, ——, etc., none of which in any sense causes
the death of that which has begun to live,
as is the case in abortion, cannot by law be described.</p>

<p>While it has been conclusively proved that in
countries like Holland where birth control is not
only legalized but made a matter of public instruction,
the birth rate declines, <em>but</em> the death rate declines
<em>still more</em>, legislators in this country have
apparently gone on the principle that more unintelligent
voters were more desirable than fewer intelligent
voters. For where the death rate, due to birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
control, is still less than the birth rate the result is
a great increase in intelligence as well as eventually
in population.</p>

neurologists, and published in <cite>Mental Hygiene</cite> (Oct., 1920)
was the following: “Do you consider that absolute continence
is always to be insisted upon, or may it be taught that under
certain conditions intercourse in the unmarried is harmless or
beneficial?”</p>

<p>To this question A. A. Brill of New York gave the following
answer: “Years ago I encouraged intercourse in some neurotics
who were constantly worrying about sex. I soon found out that it
had not benefited them. The same factors which produced the
original conflicts continued to disturb them. Now I remove their
conflicts by analysis, and then they need no advice. I have known
a number of cases who have successfully abstained from two to
three years following analysis.”</p>

“abnormal sexual desire.” But that is simply because the
doctors got hold of it first. There is no Greek word <em>erotism</em>

element in autoerotism and allerotism and being shorter than
eroticism was adopted by the present writer to name the highest

as follows (<cite>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite>, Vol. I, page 161):
“By ‘autoerotism’ I mean the phenomena of spontaneous sexual
emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding,
directly or indirectly, from another person.” The present
writer calls autoerotic those husbands who, in the love episode,
secure their own erotic acme, in which their sexual, if not their
erotic, tension is relaxed; but either do not know or do not care
whether their wives reach a corresponding relaxation. The
opposite of autoerotism is allerotism, where the husband places
on the wife’s erotic relaxation a value at least equal to that
which he places on his own.</p>

“The evil effects produced upon the child witnessing marital bickerings,
the household inspiration it receives with regard to judgment-feelings
about women and men, the decisive manner in which
parents affect it when they transfer their conflicts on the child—these
capital facts the life histories of homosexuals given above
illustrate very clearly for anyone willing to look squarely at the
truth. We do not yet appreciate how careful we must be in our
relations with the children. Our educators are still guilty of a
serious blunder when they conceive their duty to be to instil
goodness in the child through the instrumentality of fear. There
are only two educational levers: one’s own example and—love.
The healthiest children come from happy marriages. It is
love that determines whether a marriage shall be a happy one
and whether the offspring will be healthy or weak. The unconscious
sexual instinct manifesting itself in love is the guide for
the regeneration of the human race. Social conditions favouring
early love marriages are the only social reform to which I look
for results.” (Page 316.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Dr. Alice B. Stockham, <cite>Karezza: Ethics of Marriage</cite>, N. Y.,
1896. She recommends that both husband and wife refrain from
the erotic acme. “During a lengthy period of perfect control, the
whole being of each is merged into the other, and an exquisite
exaltation experienced. This may be accompanied by a quiet
motion, entirely under subordination of the will, so that the thrill
of passion may not go beyond a pleasurable exchange.... With
abundant time and mutual reciprocity the interchange becomes satisfactory
and complete, without emission or crisis. In the course
of an hour the physical tension subsides, the spiritual exaltation
increases and not uncommonly visions of a transcendent life are
seen and consciousness of new powers experienced.” (Page 25.)
She suggests that such episodes should take place from two weeks
to three months apart, and should be the only type of love episode
except where procreation is desired.</p>
